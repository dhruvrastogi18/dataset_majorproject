4,132_4,4,132_4,7_4,T,"it's still there. Three is still suffering, but not as much as before. And not nearly as much as the peak. ",id,,

6,132_6,6,132_6,7_6,T,"Do you think going forward, you can apply this self talk in the morning, when that automatic clock comes up, like we make that kind of plan.",yq,,
7,132_7,7,132_7,7_7,P,"Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.",op,id,1.0
8,132_8,8,132_8,7_8,T,"There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well.",id,,
9,132_9,9,132_9,7_9,P,Okay. What should I do with it? Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or?,ack,crq,
10,132_10,10,132_10,7_10,T,"Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in. To the extent you're comfortable talking about, we can go over. Okay. And we'll try to together develop self talk to address that. Okay. So we're going to build, we're going to build an inventory of adaptive responses. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?",cd,yq,
11,132_11,11,132_11,7_11,P,"No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything. I can do that.",on,id,
12,132_12,12,132_12,7_12,T,"I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?",id,irq,
13,132_13,13,132_13,7_13,P,"Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.",id,,1.0
14,132_14,14,132_14,7_14,T,"Yeah, so I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now. But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you'll face new ones. And I want you to be the most prepared you can be I feel like even though you have these worries and anxieties, I want I'd like you to remember you have a lot of strengths. I feel like you can do pretty well with this. So we'll stop there. If You're good and we'll set you up for appointments next week.",id,,
