0,138_0,138_0,T," All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend, and from what I hear while you were there, and you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.",gc,0
1,138_1,138_1,P," All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized. ","gc, id",-1
