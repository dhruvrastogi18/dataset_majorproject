58,159_58,159_58,T,Okay.,gc,0
59,159_59,159_59,P,"But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time.",id,-3
60,159_60,159_60,T,I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty?,"gc, crq",0
61,159_61,159_61,P,Yeah.,cd,0

66,159_66,159_66,T,I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting.,gc,0
67,159_67,159_67,P,I've been doing pretty good,gc,0
68,159_68,159_68,T,you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings?,gc,0

70,159_70,159_70,T,"Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim.",gc,0
71,159_71,159_71,P,"Yeah, cuz she's stupid.",gc,-3
72,159_72,159_72,T,"Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind?","gc, yp",0
73,159_73,159_73,P,Yeah. That's right.,op,0
74,159_74,159_74,T,"So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting.",gc,0
75,159_75,159_75,P,Okay,gc,0
76,159_76,159_76,T,that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit.,gc,0
77,159_77,159_77,P,"It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three, though. I'll tell you that much.",gc,-3
78,159_78,159_78,T,It might not. But it'll bring it down a little bit. Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more.,gc,0
79,159_79,159_79,P,All right,gc,0
80,159_80,159_80,T,maybe there'll be things will feel good about later. You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back.,gc,0
81,159_81,159_81,P,All right.,gc,0
82,159_82,159_82,T,"So the first thing is that pencil, it sounds like it's comforting to have it. ",gc,0
83,159_83,159_83,P,"Yeah, it is.",gc,0
84,159_84,159_84,T,"It also sounds like it's tempting, What do you think about that?","gc,orq",0
85,159_85,159_85,P,"I mean, Only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting",od,-3
86,159_86,159_86,T,having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things. When you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less,gc,0
87,159_87,159_87,P,"Yeah, I am.",gc,0
88,159_88,159_88,T,Sounds like that pencils standing in your way.,gc,0
89,159_89,159_89,P,"Yeah, maybe.",gc,0
90,159_90,159_90,T,"What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time, choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can't cut with. ",orq,0
91,159_91,159_91,P,"I mean, maybe only, only if it's can be like a really cool pencil",od,0
92,159_92,159_92,T,That way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you. That'll make it easier to try the two things.,"gc, id",0
93,159_93,159_93,P,Yeah.,gc,0
94,159_94,159_94,T,"Okay, what do you think our first thing should be? What do you think you can try? You just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry. What can you do in that moment?","gc, orq, irq",0
95,159_95,159_95,P,"Oh, what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on.",id,-3
96,159_96,159_96,T,Do you have your headphones with you at  school?,yq,0
97,159_97,159_97,P,"Yeah, they they they actually they let me keep them on in school.",op,0
98,159_98,159_98,T,Is that something you'd be willing to try next time?,irq,0
99,159_99,159_99,P,I think so. there's a there's a few songs that usually helped me so I think so.,id,-3
100,159_100,159_100,T,"Okay, that sounds like a good one to try. So we have headphones, we need to come up with One more. What do you think you'd like to try?","gc, orq",0
101,159_101,159_101,P,"Well, I really like my teacher, Mrs. Xion. So she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk. And her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker than the same hallway. So I guess I could talk to her. ","od, id",-3
102,159_102,159_102,T,"That sounds like a good option. That's our goal is to keep pushing, cutting further down the list, and keep adding things that you're going to try first. And you're right that the first thing you try, it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three, but it might bring you down a little bit. And each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more. So you have to be willing to try a few things. Can you do that?","gc, id, yq",0
103,159_103,159_103,P,"I can, but I really want like a cooler pencil though, like, like a cooler pencil, so I don't know, maybe, maybe we could go look for a pencil together.",yq,0
104,159_104,159_104,T,I think that's a good idea.,gc,0
105,159_105,159_105,P,"Okay, I'd like that. ",gc,0
