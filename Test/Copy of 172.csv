5,172_5,172_5,P,"I mean, I've been feeling like really isolated lately. You know, because I'm a stay at home mom. It's hard. There's not a lot of people. You know, right at my fingertips to spend my time with, you know, obviously my family but, um, so I guess, you know, I kind of I had some friends in the neighborhood, but like, our friendships just kind of fizzled out. And I ever since then it's just like, I don't really feel like doing much. I just kind of feel like what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff. But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever. And when I do do it, I just feel like I'm forcing myself to do it. The passion is gone.",id,-1

7,172_7,172_7,P,"For a long time, I have two boys. They're eight and 10 and I've been staying home since my first one was born. So 10 years and you know, it's it's been really rewarding for me I'm not really interested in going back to work or anything like that. Because I know people always say you're, you know, you're feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it's not it. You know, I've felt happy with it for so long. I don't think that it's being home. I think it's some thing inside of me.",id,-1

No, that's what changed.","gc, irq",0
9,172_9,172_9,P,"Yeah, exactly. Well, I guess, you know, my youngest is eight. So he's only been in school for a couple of years. So I guess like, it's not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home. So it's more, it's more time to myself. And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things. Like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while. And like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of like, fill that time. But now that stuff, it's just not really happening anymore. So now I kind of feel like it's not it's not boredom, you know, it's not like I don't have enough to do. It's like, I don't want to do anything. But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do.","ack, id",-1

15,172_15,172_15,P,"Yeah, I mean, obviously, my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning. He's really supportive. I know he can tell that I'm not feeling the same. But you know, he works. And then he has to come home and pick up my slack. So he's getting frustrated, which I understand. And, you know, my mom has said to me that, you know, she thinks I'm not doing as much and so it kind of hurts. It feels like everybody's trying to tell me I'm lazy and then I'm not doing enough and it's always that like feeling, you know, like nobody really understands how much work that goes into being a mother, but then at the same time now that I'm doing less and less, I feel like they're all right.

He picked up the slack and it was fine, but now that it's been and more he's kind of getting frustrated and, you know, he's been asking me about how I feel and why I'm not doing as much but at the same time, like, even though he knows that I'm not motivated, it's still frustrating because I, it's my responsibility. So I think he's, you know, he's been saying, like, I need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said, I need you to do more.",id,-1

27,172_27,172_27,P,"Yeah. Yeah, I actually think, you know, I've been feeling this way more like in the past, like six months or something like that, like I, it was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in like the natural way that it is hard. But this is something else this is more consuming. It's, you know, like the difficulty of him going away to school, almost was motivating, like it was hard, but at the same time, it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff. This is just like stunting.",id,-1
28,172_28,172_28,T,"Okay, so I'm gonna shift gears a little bit. Can you tell me about your well, a recent day? So it's kind of typical what you're telling me now meaning not motivated down?","gc, irq",0
29,172_29,172_29,P,"Sure. Onn Wednesday, I was having a really hard time getting out of bed. So my husband just got the kids ready in the morning and I felt really bad about that. So I just stayed in bed for a couple more hours, probably until like 1030. And I got up you know, I'm made myself something to eat. And then I thought, you know, I should probably go to the store because we're almost out of milk. And, you know, and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just, I just sat down and I just sat there and I think I sat for I don't even know how long the boys came home from school. It was like, you know, 330 and I hadn't even gotten up. And so then I said, Okay, the boys are home. I should probably get started on dinner soon, because my husband will be home soon. And I found I found something in the fridge to make and I made dinner and you know, after that everybody, you know, just sat down, we just watch TV and I just sat there until it was time to go to bed.",id,-1

31,172_31,172_31,P,Ummhuhh,cd,0
32,172_32,172_32,T,What would the ideal day of look like take that same day and do you wish you could have done?,irq,0
33,172_33,172_33,P,"I wish that I would wake up and you know, I would want to wake up when it was time for the kids to get ready to school to go to school. You know, I could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed, I could pay for lunches and get the boys dressed and you know, check they needed any permission slip sign, that kind of thing. Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store. I probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house. I used to like have like a list of chores that like I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff. So like bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing. So I would probably like follow that list. Nowadays I just, you know if it gets done, it gets done and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff and you know, I would do the bathrooms one day a week that probably gets done like once a month now. But um, I would do that so do the cleaning. If we if I needed to go to the story we do that. I get ready for the boys to come home I'd probably make them a snack and and figure out what was going to be for dinner, I would go ahead and do that. And then probably, you know, sometimes we we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do, we could play a board game or or watch a movie as a family or something like that. And that would be after the kids did their homework and everything like that. And then after we spent some time together, I put them in a bed.",id,-1
34,172_34,172_34,T,"Alright, so it's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be. So let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up. Right? You did. So you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep. And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things. ",gc,0
35,172_35,172_35,P,Right.,ack,0
36,172_36,172_36,T,"How did you feel alone Not to happen, because clearly that's not what you want to happen. How did you feel about oversleeping?",irq,0
37,172_37,172_37,P,"I just like, you know, the alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up and my husband's getting out of bed and I just look at the clock and I think, what's the point and, you know, it's just this instant feeling of I can't even describe it like pointlessness of getting up. And so, I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it. You know, like, it's a catch 22 like, I don't want to wake up, I just don't want to, but then when I go back to sleep, I feel bad. I feel guilty. ",id,-1
38,172_38,172_38,T,"Okay, so I'm not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point, can you expand on that?",irq,0
39,172_39,172_39,P,"It just it's just like, you know, when I'm sleeping, I don't realize how sad I am. And I don't realize how hard it is to function. When I'm sleeping. I'm not aware of that as soon as I wake up I am. And so I just have this feeling of like, what's the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have to",id,-1
40,172_40,172_40,T,What's the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back?,irq,0
41,172_41,172_41,P,"Yes, yeah. ",id,0
42,172_42,172_42,T,"Okay. But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept.",irq,0
43,172_43,172_43,P,"Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.",id,-1
44,172_44,172_44,T,"So really, functionally, what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain.",gc,0
45,172_45,172_45,P,yeah,ack,0
46,172_46,172_46,T,"And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you're not getting your kids off to school. Your husband's getting real frustrated. ",gc,0
47,172_47,172_47,P,yeah,ack,0
48,172_48,172_48,T,"And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And you know, presumably without without pain because you're sleeping, but you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense? ","gc, yq",0
49,172_49,172_49,P,Yeah.,op,0
50,172_50,172_50,T,"Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?",irq,0
51,172_51,172_51,P,"Yeah, it was so easy. I would just like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it's time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go. I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was a little bit tired, it would be a little bit harder. You know, it's not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, so it's not usually too hard to get up and I would, I would, you know, it would be another good day, you know, I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of and I felt accomplished.",id,-1
52,172_52,172_52,T,"So maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, So in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and ","gc, irq",0
53,172_53,172_53,P,"yeah, I mean, I want everything to be normal again. And I guess I never really thought of it like that. Like, I just thought, Well, if I'm waking up at the right time, and I'm just feeling bad then like, like I said, What's the point, but I guess it makes sense. Like, even if I don't feel like doing it, maybe it'll make me feel better if I do do it, even if it's hard, because nothing is really harder than when I'm already going through.",id,-1
54,172_54,172_54,T,"Well, it seems like you're, you're more or less making things worse, right? In an effort to avoid the pain that you're going to suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse, and just delaying it a little bit, right. What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless. Right, and I'm going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer. That's a version of the thought.","gc, irq",0
55,172_55,172_55,P,"Does that make sense? And also, I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn't really be that beneficial to get up. ",id,0
56,172_56,172_56,T,Okay. So minimizing the benefit.,gc,0
57,172_57,172_57,P,Yeah.,ack,0
58,172_58,172_58,T,"So there's a couple of things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by slipping in. And there's really no point to getting out because I won't do any good anyway. ",gc,0
59,172_59,172_59,P,Yeah.,ack,0
60,172_60,172_60,T,"What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you're, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you're thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway.","gc, cv",0
61,172_61,172_61,P,"I mean, I guess I could tell myself like I can do this. Like Instead of, you know, when I say to myself, what's the point instead I can say, I can do this? I can get out of it. It'll be okay. I can. I'm strong enough, even though it's hard to push through the pain and get up now, even though I don't want to, I can say I can do this. ",cr,-1
62,172_62,172_62,T,"Okay. So that would be adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this, but it will be difficult. Right? How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school. The automatic thought right now is telling you that's not valuable. But I think that you believe it is valuable.","gc, irq",0
63,172_63,172_63,P,"Yeah, I mean, I know it's valuable. I guess what my frustration is, is that I know it's valuable and it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like, pride and, and satisfaction and now I'm not getting that anymore. So I guess I need to realize that even though I'm not getting it right now. If I keep trying, maybe it will happen again, because it did happen before,",id,-1
64,172_64,172_64,T,"it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back. If you do get up, then if you guess that's true, right? ",irq,0
65,172_65,172_65,P,"So never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school,",id,-1
66,172_66,172_66,T,she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do.,gc,0
67,172_67,172_67,P,I never thought about it like that.,gc,-1
68,172_68,172_68,T,That kind of makes sense?,yq,0
69,172_69,172_69,P,"Yeah, yeah.",op,0
70,172_70,172_70,T,"So even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move. Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you're going through is probably depression. Right now what I like to talk to you further, to make sure that's what's going on seems like you're depressed, and sometimes with depression, you just have to get one thing going your way each day. Right? So, so I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here. Right? It's, it's more like, Can I do this one thing? Okay, I proved to myself, just what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up. See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow. Right and build on that. ","gc, id",0
71,172_71,172_71,P,Yeah. Yeah.,ack,0
72,172_72,172_72,T,"And part of that's going to be playing those adaptive responses back, right thinking of those thoughts. Whether it's just thinking them, you know, in your mind or actually thinking them and saying, sometimes it's helpful just to say them out loud,",gc,0
73,172_73,172_73,P,"Not letting the negative thoughts take over because that's what I'm thinking like, okay, I can get the kids off to school, but after that, I'm going to start thinking You know, what's the point again? Like, what? Why don't I just sit down, there's just no point. So if I can keep reminding myself that I just have to try, and that I did accomplish something, and then, you know, even though it's hard, and I know that those thoughts are going to come back, and then I'm going to feel bad. If I don't do anything, I'm not going to feel any better.","gc, id",0
74,172_74,172_74,T,"So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds like right. And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do. I'll see again in a week, and there'll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right. So I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right? school days, and you may not succeed every day. And that's okay. Right?","gc, id",0
