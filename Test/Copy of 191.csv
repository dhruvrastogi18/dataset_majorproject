47,191_47,191_47,P,"Well, wow. He kind of did calm me down. I mean, I was kind of getting anxious telling you what made me anxious. And so I was kind of revved up, and then I kind of forgot about it, because I was focusing on you know, what I was seeing and what I was feeling and when I was, you know, all my senses of so it was very distracting. Damon a good way I got my mind off of that, and kind of got me on to something else. And then, yeah, they really did cut me down.",id,

57,191_57,191_57,P,"Yeah, yeah, I think the music might be more because not that I want to be distracted from the cars.
