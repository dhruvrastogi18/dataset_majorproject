Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings I can appreciate. It's really painful. And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts. I think that you'll see it's it's helpful although I know It's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes. But I'd like to try to kind of distinguish between the two. Okay. You said that you've been at your job for about five years. You really like your job.

So it was kind of like, I was enjoying myself, you know, not super fast. I wasn't having the best time of my life, but it was something where I would go and you know, I felt like I was doing something important and the day didn't drag on and, you know, I got along with my co workers and that kind of thing. So it felt meaningful to me. meaningful.",id,,2.0

3,2_3,3,2_3,10_3,P,"Yeah, I feel like, you know, doing my job, I got to know people, you know, help people out with things that they needed. You know, when things were bad I could, you know, get kids out of situations that were really dangerous for them and, you know, no one else was going to do that for them. So I felt like I was the kind of person that was making keeping people safe. I guess.",cd,,
4,2_4,4,2_4,10_4,T,You kept people safe. And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did. And now doesn't feel that way?,yq,,

9,2_9,9,2_9,10_9,P,"I mean, I guess it's like, quantitatively the same as before. I do the same things with families. But now I kind of feel like I can't trust my own judgment like everything. Before everything just kind of felt a little more black and white, and now it just feels like everything is so much a shade of gray that I just can't tell. You know what's right and what's wrong anymore. And every time I feel like I have a good instinct I doubt it I question it I have all these ideas of, well, you know, if I remove the kids from this family, what if they're not really doing the things? I think they're doing? Like what if the parents are actually good parents? What if the kids get put into a home that's bad for them?",id,,-2.0

11,2_11,11,2_11,10_11,P,"Yeah, sometimes it was tougher than others, but it just seemed more like I could make a decision and kind of wipe my hands of it and, you know, move on to the next thing. And now I just feel like there's all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I'm doing the right thing.",id,,
12,2_12,12,2_12,10_12,T,"All right. So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the right decision. And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind. What could go wrong here? Is that the thought you're having?",irq,,
13,2_13,13,2_13,10_13,P,"Yeah, yeah, definitely. I feel like I'm second guessing everything.",id,,-2.0
