1,213_1,213_1,P,I'm feeling disgust,id,
2,213_2,213_2,T,Disgust about what.,crq,
3,213_3,213_3,P,I can't do this.,"on,cd",
4,213_4,213_4,T,"Like you can't do this. So, so tell me what that feeling of disgust is. What do you disgust it about?",irq,
5,213_5,213_5,P,"Just my body like just, I don't know, I feel like eating that just makes my body feel you know, gross like uncomfortable, I don't know.",id,
6,213_6,213_6,T,"Yeah. Well, it sounds like there's some judgments in there. Right. So it sounds like probably you're having some judgments like, I'm feeling really bad. ",crq,
7,213_7,213_7,P,"Yeah, yeah",ack,
8,213_8,213_8,T,"that sort of thing. But you did say it more descriptively which is great, which is you're feeling uncomfortable right now.",gc,
9,213_9,213_9,P,"Right, Just eating not makes me feel icky. I don't know. Just",ack,
10,213_10,213_10,T,"Yeah. And I can totally understand how you get to there. If you're thinking, I'm feeling fat. I'm going to get fat. You know, it's an easy place to get to. Okay. ",gc,
11,213_11,213_11,P,Okay.,ack,
12,213_12,213_12,T,"But I feel like we're missing something, too, because I don't think it's justice. I think there's another primary emotion in there. What do you think that might be?",orq,
13,213_13,213_13,P,"Well, I feel like just looking at that I've that cake. I feel like I just want to run out the door. I just don't want to be here.",od,
14,213_14,213_14,T,Sure. So what what emotion do you think that is?,orq,
15,213_15,213_15,P,Being afraid being a fearful of what will happen if I eat that?,od,
16,213_16,213_16,T,"I think that's exactly right. That's what I'm seeing. You know, I see you kind of crawled up over there. You know, you have a very worried faced, you know, and you're having a hard time approaching it. I think I think that's absolutely right, that you're feeling fear. And I want you to know, that makes a lot of sense to me. You know, when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake.","id,irq",
17,213_17,213_17,P,I honestly I can't remember. I don't know.,"on,id",
18,213_18,213_18,T,"I know it's been it's been a really long time. you certainly didn't need it all through, you know, when you were really stuck in your eating disorder, you know,",gc,
19,213_19,213_19,P,"I used to, I used to like it. I remember that, but it was such a long time ago.",gc,
20,213_20,213_20,T,I know And so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear.,gc,
21,213_21,213_21,P,Right.,ack,
22,213_22,213_22,T,"And you had said, this is one of the hardest foods for you. So that makes sense to me.",crq,
23,213_23,213_23,P,"Right. I just see it like, as a big blob of fat","cd,ack",
24,213_24,213_24,T,right,ack,
25,213_25,213_25,P,That's it looks like to me,gc,
26,213_26,213_26,T,that's what. what! what is that? It's a big blob of fat.,irq,
27,213_27,213_27,P,A judgement?,crq,
28,213_28,213_28,T,"Yeah, exactly. You know, I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that. All right. Okay. So, because that's just not going to be helpful right now. So what I'm wondering is Since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with, maybe we can do some opposite action to that emotion. Do you remember what I mean by opposite action?",cd,
29,213_29,213_29,P,Mm hmm.,ack,
30,213_30,213_30,T,What do I mean?,irq,
31,213_31,213_31,P,"Instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this, and just, you know, check out basically, you want me to go towards it, and, you know, just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it. ",id,
32,213_32,213_32,T,"Right, exactly. So, you know, fears associated with that urge, like you said, to run out the door. So instead of running out the door, we want you to approach the thing that's scary, which is this cheesecake right now. Right? ",yq,
33,213_33,213_33,P,Right.,ack,
34,213_34,213_34,T,"Okay. So I see how hard it is. For you and I, honestly, it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away. But as you know, the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake, it's just gonna make you more fearful The next time you come in front of some kind of food, that's tougher for you",od,
35,213_35,213_35,P,Yeah it makes it worse.,on,
36,213_36,213_36,T,"Yeah. So by doing this, hopefully over time, your fear will go down. Okay. So can we have the fear right now And still take a few more bites?",yq,
37,213_37,213_37,P,Okay,ack,
38,213_38,213_38,T,All right. Okay. Let's do it. So how was that?,orq,
39,213_39,213_39,P,This is difficult,od,
40,213_40,213_40,T,"Yeah, I can see how difficult it is.",gc,
41,213_41,213_41,P,"But I'm doing it, but its difficult. ",od,
42,213_42,213_42,T,Exactly.,ack,
43,213_43,213_43,P,Doesn't feel comfortable.,on,
44,213_44,213_44,T,"No, I wouldn't imagine it would. But you did perfect opposite action right there, which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that, but you still did it. ",od,
45,213_45,213_45,P,Right.,ack,
46,213_46,213_46,T,Do you feel a little bit proud of yourself?,irq,
47,213_47,213_47,P,"Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.",ack,
48,213_48,213_48,T,Okay. So this shows me that you can do it. So let's try again. Let's take a breath. And then we'll go back and do more opposite action.,irq,
