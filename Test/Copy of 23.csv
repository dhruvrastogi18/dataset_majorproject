0,23_0,0,23_0,12_0,T,"So, alright, let's take a step back and talk about competency. What education Did you need for the job you have now?",irq,,
1,23_1,1,23_1,12_1,P,I have my bachelor's degree. And we got a little bit of training. You know every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that.,id,,
2,23_2,2,23_2,12_2,T,Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you're in a job you should be?,yq,,
3,23_3,3,23_3,12_3,P,"Yeah, I have a supervisor so they check up on stuff and also like if I feel like I have questions and stuff like that, I can go to them as well.",op,,
4,23_4,4,23_4,12_4,T,Have you been Found in that system to be somebody who's satisfying the requirements of in terms of competency satisfy the requirements of employee.,yq,,
5,23_5,5,23_5,12_5,P,"Yeah, I mean, I haven't been fired. So that's a good sign again,",op,,1.0
6,23_6,6,23_6,12_6,T,"that's a good sign. Yeah, you haven't been fired. Have you ever had any type of write up or somebody discussing something with you?",yq,,
7,23_7,7,23_7,12_7,P,"No, I just I kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after this happened, like maybe other people think I didn't make the right decision. I guess maybe that's part of where all my doubts are coming from, like, no one has said to me and I have, you know, my supervisor hasn't called me in and said, I'm concerned about this, but I just feel like maybe  other people think that I did something wrong.",on,id,
8,23_8,8,23_8,12_8,T,"Alright, so there's no there's no evidence supporting that. In a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to, but there's no other evidence supporting it based on your, what you're feeling, how you're perceiving things. Yeah, you're getting this feeling that, by the way, they're interacting with you.",crq,,
9,23_9,9,23_9,12_9,P,"Yeah. Which, I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like, the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn't lose their jobs. So it's not like, you know, I, you know, I don't know, I guess it's not like just hearing them, or thinking that they're judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake.",id,,
10,23_10,10,23_10,12_10,T,"Alright, so you can see that I'm talking this through you can see that. So some of this could be feelings. Thoughts you're having, combined with what you're actually observing share, you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little more destructive, or more negative.",id,,
11,23_11,11,23_11,12_11,P,"Yeah, it's kind of like, I know, it's not that big of a deal because, like I said, My supervisor hasn't talked to me and it's not like I've heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything like that. But I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like, oh, was she you know, saying something? You know, when she said that? Did she was she referring to what happened? and stuff like that?",id,,
12,23_12,12,23_12,12_12,T,Can you can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this?,irq,,
13,23_13,13,23_13,12_13,P,"Yeah. So like we were having like our regular work week. And we kind of like, you know, discuss how things are going. And it's been kind of a big deal what, you know, more so than usual that the kids were removed from this family. So, you know, one of my co workers kind of nudged me and said, like, oh, you're the bulldozer you, you know, you plowed right through that family took those kids away. And, you know, I think she meant it kind of, like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say, like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel like does she think that I'm just callous? Like, does she think that I just didn't care and you get what I'm saying?",id,,-2.0
14,23_14,14,23_14,12_14,T,"So she referred to as a bulldozer. And one way to take that would be powerful, efficient. Another way to take that would be kind of destructive we talked about before destructive powers. They're mechanical they don't have a lot of feeling.",id,,
15,23_15,15,23_15,12_15,P,Yeah.,ack,,
16,23_16,16,23_16,12_16,T,So you don't know exactly know how she meant it but you're thinking maybe it was negative,id,,
17,23_17,17,23_17,12_17,P,"yeah. And I guess it kind of like goes back to like my fear that I didn't think it through that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel like Was I being mechanical? Was I just was I just nonchalant about it? Should I have put more thought into it? And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt I guess you know.",id,,-1.0
18,23_18,18,23_18,12_18,T,So her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough.,crq,,
19,23_19,19,23_19,12_19,P,"Or even just thoughtful. I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a lot of thought into What I was doing exactly.",cd,,-2.0
20,23_20,20,23_20,12_20,T,"So, maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment. At the time making a decision, you would have thought through the steps more.",id,,
21,23_21,21,23_21,12_21,P,"Yeah, maybe taking a little bit more time.",ack,,
