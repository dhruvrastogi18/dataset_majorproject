17,41_17,17,41_17,137_17,P,"Right. Right. And, I mean, I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know, that would that she really enjoy going to, but, I mean, they were either like babysitting programs or they were just participants were all at like, different developmental levels so that she couldn't really she could make friends.","ack,id"

19,41_19,19,41_19,137_19,T,"You while you were there, it was difficult. Your daughter didn't really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting.",crq
20,41_20,20,41_20,137_20,P,"no, she did not she. She just there just wasn't that that sense of like, that common commonality, you know, just there was no, no basis for like friendships there were there were there were some young people there who are like screaming, yelling and who are talking to them. And she didn't know how to engage. ",cd
21,41_21,21,41_21,137_21,T,And so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect cert help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were just sort of viewing it.,gc
