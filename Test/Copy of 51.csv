And I went home and I baked the cake, but it's kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he's like, old, so I thought it'd be funny, but it wasn't apparently. But so yeah, besides that, like, this week's been awesome. And, you know, like I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money. Like with a nice increase, I should say.

9,51_9,9,51_9,146_9,P,"I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might actually because I'm proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for so long in this company. And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself. And so I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills right now. Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it. So that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it. So it didn't work out. And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me. So besides I've been fine.","cd,id"
