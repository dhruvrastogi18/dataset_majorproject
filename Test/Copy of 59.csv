11,59_11,11,59_11,153_11,P,"I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from.",id
12,59_12,12,59_12,153_12,T,"Yeah, are your friends the problem? Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with?",irq
13,59_13,13,59_13,153_13,P,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account.

14,59_14,14,59_14,153_14,T,"Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.","gc,orq"
15,59_15,15,59_15,153_15,P,"Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking. ","ack,od"
16,59_16,16,59_16,153_16,T,I think you really need to quit.,orq
17,59_17,17,59_17,153_17,P,"Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.","ack,od"
18,59_18,18,59_18,153_18,T,"Think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing.

Like I, I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much, or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.",id
22,59_22,22,59_22,153_22,T,"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get to trial here and stop drinking.",gc
23,59_23,23,59_23,153_23,P,"Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into an A life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.",gc
