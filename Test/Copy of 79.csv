0,79_0,0,79_0,20_0,T,"Alright, so let's see if we could just talk about the moment of the presentation again. I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down. ",id,,
1,79_1,1,79_1,20_1,P,"Okay, right. ",ack,,
2,79_2,2,79_2,20_2,T,"Let's actually go right before the moment so you're still in the, you're still sitting down, and you're getting ready to present. Let's just say your second present. Yeah, like we've talked about and you're thinking they're going to seeming as anxious. They're gonna think I don't belong here. These are the right. Okay. So these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already. It's perfectly natural. It's not right or wrong. Everyone has these beliefs. And whenever these beliefs are and we'll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, ",id,,
3,79_3,3,79_3,20_3,P,okay,ack,,
4,79_4,4,79_4,20_4,T," And just like the beliefs, they're not good or bad. They don't say anything about the person having them. They're just thoughts. Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts. The problem is that they lead to symptoms. So, you're sitting there at your desk, and you're thinking, they're gonna see that I'm anxious. They're gonna realize I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough, right? What reaction Do you have when you have that far?",id,irq,
5,79_5,5,79_5,20_5,P,"I guess I'm like very observant, like I started looking around, like, I'm sweating. Like I'm having physical responses, and I'm looking around to see if anyone's already looking at me, like hyper vigilance.",id,,
6,79_6,6,79_6,20_6,T,so distressing symptoms.,id,,-1.0
7,79_7,7,79_7,20_7,P,Yeah.,ack,,
8,79_8,8,79_8,20_8,T,"What's something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, so that thought of, I'm not gonna know I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough. And that reaction",irq,,
9,79_9,9,79_9,20_9,P,"I mean, I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who's presenting and not at me. And so that, you know, I can maybe like, take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down. Maybe like look over my notes one more time. Because they're all watching the person who is presenting not me.",id,,
10,79_10,10,79_10,20_10,T,"Okay. So some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, like preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway for a moment. Okay, good. Good. Um, you bring your notes with you to class?",id,irq,
11,79_11,11,79_11,20_11,P,"I mean, like usually have like index cards, or maybe like some stats on something that I want to look over like some numbers or something I don't want to forget.",id,,
12,79_12,12,79_12,20_12,T,Okay. So You always have those with you.,yq,,
13,79_13,13,79_13,20_13,P,Yeah.,op,,
14,79_14,14,79_14,20_14,T,It's just a matter of can you focus your attention on them?,yq,,
15,79_15,15,79_15,20_15,P,"Right, exactly enough to not forget them.",id,,
16,79_16,16,79_16,20_16,T,"And you know, if you're focusing on that, and you're thinking about that, you're not thinking about whatever they might be thinking about",crq,,
17,79_17,17,79_17,20_17,P,"Right, exactly.",cd,,
18,79_18,18,79_18,20_18,T,And how about the deep breathing? Is that a strategy you've tried before?,irq,,
19,79_19,19,79_19,20_19,P,"a little bit, but with not much success, because usually when I think to remember it, I'm in, you know, panic mode, and then it's really hard.",id,,
20,79_20,20,79_20,20_20,T,So you've been able to do it sometimes.,crq,,
21,79_21,21,79_21,20_21,P,"Yeah, not often, not consistently.",op,cd,
