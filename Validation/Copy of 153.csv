2,153_2,153_2,T,Not too good?,crq,0
3,153_3,153_3,P,"Yeah. So something happened over this past week I was I was driving to my buddy's house and I forgot that my tags for my car is  expired earlier this month. So I got pulled over for that and then I don't know why I did this but the cop asked to search my car and I was like, yeah, that's fine like whatever because he said he had two searches. This is getting towed. And I completely forgot that I had my junk bag in the trunk. So we opened the trunk and he was looking through the bag. So he found me he found everything. I had my weed in there at the bottom the pipe like all my pieces. So I got a, I got in trouble for possession. So I just I just want him to court and the judge offered me this decision. He said that I could either do two weeks of community service like about 80 hours, or I could pay $1,000 fine. And I'm trying to I'm really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better I guess, the both kind of suck but","cd, id",-1
4,153_4,153_4,T,"So you're struggling with the decision between two options you perceived as negative, right. ",crq,0
5,153_5,153_5,P,Right.,cd,0
6,153_6,153_6,T,Now we've discussed the marijuana usage before was just probably the root of this problem. Right?,crq,0
7,153_7,153_7,P,Right.,cd,0
8,153_8,153_8,T,But it sounds like you didn't really want to explore change this time.,crq,0
9,153_9,153_9,P,"No, I mean, it's it's really not a problem like it's just they don't really want it problem is that I got caught like I'm doing good in school works fine. So obviously like marijuana is other than just going to court It has never been a problem.","cd, id",-1
10,153_10,153_10,T,So let's focus on this decision then.,gc,0
11,153_11,153_11,P,Right,gc,0
12,153_12,153_12,T,so the decision is between a couple weeks of  community service what kind of community service?,crq,0
13,153_13,153_13,P,just picking up crap inside of the road?,cd,0
14,153_14,153_14,T,"Or $1,000 fine?",crq,0
15,153_15,153_15,P,Yeah.,cd,0
16,153_16,153_16,T,And do you have the thousand dollars?,yq,0
17,153_17,153_17,P,"I do, but I have I got a vacation coming up and I definitely like I want to I want to keep the money for like a little little vacation we'd like do some, some fun stuff with my buddies. Definitely like I want to keep that money. But I mean, I also like the community service is like also kind of close to the vacation so I might have to like give up part of the vacation or to to do the two weeks so that I think that didn't really help my decision either.",op,-1
18,153_18,153_18,T,"Do you see any value in either one of these options, which is all become negative?",yq,0
19,153_19,153_19,P,"I mean, really, like they both they both have the same negative, I guess like, like if I if I do the community service that I like, you know, I do get to keep the money. But I mean other hand, like if I keep the money, I'm doing community service, like I'm not gonna have all the time to spend the money. So it's now I mean, neither really have a positive and both the negatives are kind of equal to so it's it's kind of tough to choose.",on,-1
20,153_20,153_20,T,"So let's talk about what's important to try to help you make this decision. Really what you're going to have to determine is, and what I want to explore is the importance of keeping the money. Right, because that's really what this comes down to. ",gc,0
21,153_21,153_21,P,Right.,gc,0
22,153_22,153_22,T,"You You keep it and you do the service, or you spend it and you don't do the service?",crq,0
23,153_23,153_23,P,right,cd,0
24,153_24,153_24,T,So you could you could say that it's about the importance of keeping the money rr you could say it's about the importance of avoiding the community service.,crq,0
25,153_25,153_25,P,Right.,cd,0
26,153_26,153_26,T,"So let's talk a little about that. What How would you say on a scale of one to 10, where 10 is very important. How would you scale keeping the money?",irq,0
27,153_27,153_27,P,"I mean, that's obviously pretty high. Like, I guess keeping the money, it'd be like a nine. Because if I, like if I, if I keep the money, obviously, I can, like use it for other other things. I'd say probably nine. ",id,0
28,153_28,153_28,T,"So keeping in mind, that's, that's very important to you. ",irq,0
29,153_29,153_29,P,Right.,id,0
30,153_30,153_30,T,So that scenario would be would lean more toward completing the community service.,irq,0
31,153_31,153_31,P,"Right. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's true. Like, I didn't think about it in that way, like if I if I give up the the two weeks of time, like, obviously that would suck, but like I have, I guess I have more of a choice of what to do with money compared to my time. You know, so I guess I could think about it that way maybe",id,0
32,153_32,153_32,T,"Well, let's look at the other side too. How important is it for you on a scale of one to 10 to avoid the community service? So we know it's a nine, right to keep the money?",irq,0
33,153_33,153_33,P,right.,id,0
34,153_34,153_34,T,How to avoid the community service ?,irq,0
35,153_35,153_35,P,"Maybe like, I guess maybe about a seven because the like the community service, I mean, it wouldn't be that bad. Obviously, like, it would be a waste of time. We're gonna have to do this crap work for for so long, but I don't know. Like, at least I know if I do the community service and it would be like done after this amount of time. You know, so I can I can always keep that in mind.",id,0
36,153_36,153_36,T,"So, as you're talking, it seems like you're leaning toward or maybe you're leaning toward completing the service. Even though you're not happy with either choice, right?",crq,0
37,153_37,153_37,P,Right,cd,0
38,153_38,153_38,T,That might be the least objectionable.,gc,0
39,153_39,153_39,P,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess cuz I never like I never thought about scaling it like that way. So yeah, I think so. ",gc,1
40,153_40,153_40,T,When do you have to make this decision by ?,irq,0
41,153_41,153_41,P,"by the end of the week So today's Tuesday, so I have like a couple of days to think it over.",id,0
42,153_42,153_42,T,And you go back before the judge on Friday,gc,0
43,153_43,153_43,P,"on Friday, yeah. When I get the decision.",gc,0
44,153_44,153_44,T,Once you weigh some of the factors with the way this importance of the money versus doing the community service,gc,0
45,153_45,153_45,P,right,gc,0
46,153_46,153_46,T,"let's meet again just before maybe on Thursday. Okay, let's meet again Thursday. And just talk about it and take a look at your decision making process and making sure that you've made a decision that you can be most happy with. I know neither option is happy option for you.
