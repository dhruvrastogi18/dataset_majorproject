27,40_27,27,40_27,136_27,P,"Well, if you had asked me when I first came in, I would have said less than one. But now I would have to say four ",id
28,40_28,28,40_28,136_28,T,Why Four and not a lower number.,irq
29,40_29,29,40_29,136_29,P,That's a good question. Let me think about it.,id
30,40_30,30,40_30,136_30,P,I guess it's a four because of the blood clots. The blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now.,id

32,40_32,32,40_32,136_32,P,A little. Yes.,ack
33,40_33,33,40_33,136_33,T,"What else if anything, makes quitting important to you?",orq
34,40_34,34,40_34,136_34,P,"Know, the bigger thing for me, is the fear of being evicted from my apartment. There's a rule that we can smoke in the house. And I stick to it for the most part, but the other day, I smoked out the window. And that was only the second time I've done it. But don't you know, the building manager caught me. So now I am sure she's going to be watching me even more. I can't lose my part. With",od

36,40_36,36,40_36,136_36,P,"I would hate to think that my sogdian they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over abiding by stupid code, even if I hate that rule. I smoked when I was pregnant with them. And thank you, Holy Mother, they were born healthy. I don't think I could live with myself if they lost their home because of something I'm doing.",id
37,40_37,37,40_37,136_37,T,So it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children. It's obvious that you're a good mom. And if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear.,yq

43,40_43,43,40_43,136_43,T,"So you've been persistent and trying and haven't been successful yet. Still, you you set a two and not a one. I'm curious about that.",irq
44,40_44,44,40_44,136_44,P,"Well, the only reason I said are two is that I tried quitting smoking when I was pregnant with Santhi and they are both. I went for two months without a cigarette with Dale. And I didn't make it past that. And that was really mad at myself for that. I really wanted to quit from my babies and I failed. I guess. I'm just hopeless. I mean, who keeps smoking when there's a baby inside? ",id
45,40_45,45,40_45,136_45,T,Sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down. And that's hard to accept given how much you love your kids.,crq
46,40_46,46,40_46,136_46,P,"Yes. And I'm doing it again right now by not following the rules. I'm addicted to cigarettes, just like a drug addict. In the end the cigarettes always with.",cd

49,40_49,49,40_49,136_49,T,"So you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit. If you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction. If you believed you could do it, you would",irq
50,40_50,50,40_50,136_50,P,I would like to do so but I just don't think I can do it.,id
51,40_51,51,40_51,136_51,T,You quit for two months when you were pregnant with tail.,irq
52,40_52,52,40_52,136_52,T,How did you do with them?,irq
53,40_53,53,40_53,136_53,P,I don't know. I just did it. I fought the urges with sucking on straws and some hard Kelly's I just did it.,id
54,40_54,54,40_54,136_54,T,So you were able to quit on your own for two months. That's impressive. Have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups?,irq
55,40_55,55,40_55,136_55,P,"No, I think people can quit. If they really want to. I'm just too weak.",id
56,40_56,56,40_56,136_56,T,"Ah, wow. You must be pretty hard on yourself. What would you say if I told you that very few people only 4% of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey.",irq
