im obsessing about a terrible breakup everything is a constant reminder how do i move on the best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal that means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact in order to move on and diminish the obsessions help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings once that takes place it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpiredsometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting whats already taken place and want things to be different the key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself to give yourself permission to grieve the loss and to start cultivating new and healthy habitspatterns reengage in your present life ask yourself what you want your life to look like and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself

how can i get myself to just move on there is no wrong or right way to define a relationship i believe each relationship we are in is an opportunity to expand and to know self on a deeper level we are conditioned to believe that we are not valued or worth much without the confirmation of others and the world around us give yourself time and try to not go to those who are toxic and enjoy the drama of others lives as s way to avoid looking at themselves

how can i get myself to just move on well there is some good news and notsogood news the good news is that people are capable of moving on from relationships even if the person showed them a sort of love that theyve never felt theyve had or deserved before sometimes even just the fact that this has happened for them can eventually see below lead them to seek out love again because they now believe they will be able to have that againso the notsogood news though is that one can not just move on id even venture to say that the pressure you may be putting on yourself to just move on and out of this yucky hole of feelings that you are in is actually too much pressure and adding to the yucky feelings as they are instead try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone even though someone didnt die there is still a significant loss you are experiencing and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve to feel whatever feelings of anger or sadness or something else that you are feeling often it is really helpful to speak those feelings i recommend professionals in this case who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle and instead that it is completely normal love is a crazy thing and the feelings can get very confusing but the last stage of grieving is acceptance and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial anger bargaining and depression

our relationship ended about 7 years ago but dont know how to let go how can i get over that person and move on i think giving yourself the space to realize that this was a significant relationship and it really had an impact on you i think you should honor that relationship and then talk about it to someone the more you try to not think of it the more you will think of it i think you should instead say thank you to that relationship thank you for showing you what qualities you like what you desire maybe even come up with a list of what that specific relationship did for you after you say thank you to that relationship then it may be time to say goodbye you obviously want to get over that person so figure out why you want to get over them why did it not work out what negative parts of the relationship do you keep forgetting to think about oftentimes people glamorize the past so for your goodbye part of this phase i would focus on the negative parts of the relationship you can also work on emotionally saying goodbye to that time in your life you are probably different than you were 7 years ago and to be honest they are probably different tooi know it sounds weird but i would recommend that you mentally say thank you and goodbye to that relationship
our relationship ended about 7 years ago but dont know how to let go how can i get over that person and move on what youre most likely trying to get over is to be attracted to the qualities which you felt attracted to in the personthe problem isnt releasing yourself from the person per se letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you valuetwo possibilities existeither you continue to feel strongly that the qualities in the past relationship are still meaningful and youd like to base your next relationship on these qualitiesor the person had qualities which are no longer relevant or necessary in your life and this is the reason the relationship endedit is possible that even if you had an adequate exposure to certain qualities in someone that you simply miss the companionship of a relationshipsee if you can figure out whether you need the qualities this person gave you or whether you simply like being part of a coupleif you like the particular qualities of your previous parter and these are still relevant to your life youll attract a partner who has similar qualitiesbasically people attract what they needthe more open you are to attracting what you need in a partner the more likely your next partner will have these qualitiesin this way youll get over the particular person and still have the satisfaction to be in a relationship
my wife just last week said she wants a divorce and its all sudden i understand that marriages have their ups and downs but i dont understand why she cant tell me why she wants a divorce should i fight for my family daughter and wife chances are if you really think about it there were signs that something wasnt quite right in your marriage you may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage but whatever it was or wasnt its obviously bothering your wife i would say yes keep trying to fight for your family at least until you know what the problems are from your wifes perspective and if theyre repairable ask your wife if shes willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor just be sure youre open to hearing whats said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some thingseven if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce that doesnt mean youre divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that continue to be a part of her life and although it may be difficult if a divorce does happen try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isnt further impacted by this new family dynamic
weve been seeing each other for six years she has a teenage daughter and she dont want to break the family up what changed that after six years you raise the question of what to do about this relationshiphad you hoped until now that she would leaveif this is so and she clearly told you she will continue in her marriage then the control is in your hands now as to how long you are willing to continue in the relationship as it is currentlyemotionally releasing from a relationship takes much longer than the time to simply announce your departure from itemotions change gradually whereas whether or not in real practical time the two of you will continue seeing each other is a clear and straightforward choiceif you decide your best interest is in leaving then do so your emotions will take a while to catch upthis is difficult and painful to do only it sounds like staying is even more difficult
he had a sexual relationship with his sister and kept it from me for years i confronted about it and he finally told me what happened but i dont think he is telling me the whole story he works with her and sees her every day i feel that i shouldnt stay with him  but he says he ended it long time ago should i trust my husband and stay with him it is understandable that you are questioning whether to trust your husband as you learned that he was involved in an incestuous relationship with his sister and you believe he hid the information from you for years i am sensing that you believe he may still be involved with her as they work together and see each other dailyin our society incest is considered a taboo and this might clearly have been the reason he could not share it with you in addition it is not clear whether the incest emerged as part of experimentationor whether it was a traumatic experience for both siblings in which one of them played the role of the malevolent perpetrator and the other the victim in any case there is complexity around the dynamics incest and it is often necessary for the individuals that participated in it to undergo a healing process in like manner it must have been distressing for you to uncover this event in your husbands life you may need to explore these issues in couples counseling with a professional who has training and experience in the family dynamics around incest that can shed further light for you i hope that through that process you may be able to figure out what direction to take in terms of whether to preserve your marriage or not

a year ago the love of my life left me and never looked back our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart i miss her so much and cant seem to get over being so heartbroken who takes care of your son is a significant part of getting over your heartbreakif you made reasonable custody terms re your son then the relationship heartache is much easier to recover from than if your sons mother vanished from his life or if the mother wants nothing to do w himre the actual relationship let yourself feel sad and hurt since this is the truthusually life gradually fills in new people including a relationship once you feel strong enough from having endured such sadness and loss
a year ago the love of my life left me and never looked back our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart i miss her so much and cant seem to get over being so heartbroken i recognize that you say you are missing being with the love of your life at the same time i dont understand whether you are able to see your son im curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your sons motherwhen you say that she never looked back i imagine you are conveying that getting back together is not something that she is interested ini would suggest that you talk with a therapist and your local area so that you have the ability to discuss the loss of this person who you love so much most people think of grief related to the loss of someone who has died but it also applies to people who have a significant loss whether that is a relationship a job or any number of other thingsin the meantime try finding something about yourself that you value and can focus on
i googled chronic lying and found several websites describing what behaviors both he and i have been experiencing both of us agree we have an uncanny unbreakable bond hes been unfaithful many times while he remains my only intimate mate how can i learn to detach from him as he is not going to change first step is to detach then learn about itan attachment to a pathological liar or to someone who is psychopathic is based on insecurity fear or a sense to rescue someone or of pity none of these attachment methods are healthy for human growth for either of you he lies to you and this is clearly not usual in relationships which truly are intimate someone who lies is not trustworthy and without trust there is also no intimacythe type of attachment between you and this person is not discussable in reasonable terms the bond is strong and irrationalonce you have separated from this person youll have more freedom to know within yourself of what kept the relationship going for seven years
i got married in 2014 i have a two year old son his mom and i decided to separate due to my infidelities weve tried to reconcile our differences but it never works out since weve been separated ive dated someone and we are expecting a baby girl is this something i should mention to my wife the current woman whom im dating has been telling me for months to break up with her but its hard because i actually love her my answer is yes you should tell her because you have a child with her she is the mother of your son and this new baby would be his half sister i think telling her is mature and appropriate usually procrastinating just makes it worseanother thing to consider would you want her to tell you if she was pregnant with her boyfriends baby hope this helps take care

i got engaged and everything was going well things went downhill at some point and i broke off the engagement due to an opportunity to go to college after that i found out she had been cheating on me i think about her all the time now and we have been communicating on and off but my friendsfamily dont know somehow you knew the marriage wouldnt have a good start if your fiancé was cheating on youcongrats on your intuition and following your intuitionan engagement breakup is full of disappointment and sometimes talking about the particular points help the couple to clarify and possibly set the relationship on new terms or feel more confident in the breakupi suggest you identify what topics re the relationship youd like to clear up with your exif both of you are having touch and go conversation which doesnt address the deeper and more troubled areas which led to the cheating and breakup there is a chance you both will go down a similar road of casual and light conversation which hits the wall of the deeper obstacles between both of youyour friends and family dont need to know anything until you feel ready to tell them what you decide to tell them
he was in love with someone years ago and he still thinks about her time to time he said and i quote that relationship is definitely over i love you but that girl will always be in my mind it just didnt feel like he appreciated all the things ive done to make him happy trust your intuition on your conclusion about this guyhe may very well love you only with the ex so prominent in his mind it is possible your feeling of not being appreciated now would multiply if ever the two of you needed to address a delicate topicsince he is emotionally attached to the former gf it is very likely he wouldnt be able to fully love you as much as youd like and are already sensing
he was in love with someone years ago and he still thinks about her time to time he said and i quote that relationship is definitely over i love you but that girl will always be in my mind it just didnt feel like he appreciated all the things ive done to make him happy it sounds like you were in a tough spot hereim not able to tell you whether or not you made a mistake because the decision is yours i am wondering what led you to ask whether you made a mistake and whether you wish you were still in the relationship with this guy if so is it an option to talk about this with himif you decide to get back together consider having some conversations about what your concerns are and taking about five minutes or so to listen to this guys thoughts feelings etc then see if you can repeat the essence of what he said to make sure you have it right then maybe you can ask some questions that you have and see if he is willing to listen when each of you is in the role of asking questions try to ask them as if you are an investigative reporter trying to learn more about each others experienceif you are looking for information on coping with breaking up and you dont want to get back together or thats not an option consider looking at how you define yourself and what is most important to you at this moment i hear you saying youve done a lot of things to make him happy im wondering what is making you happy hopefully you have friends or family that you can trust and talk to even if you dont talk about your relationship with all of them i hope you have some people around whom you can be emotionally safe and comfortable
my spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house he says he despises the sight of me wants to be with other women and divorce what i dont understand is that he says constantly that i have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if i speak to another male why does he constantly do these behaviors i might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist what a burden for youyour husband cannot seem to make up his mind on his viewpoint and doesnt seem to care whether or not youre affected by speaking out of two sides of his mouthkeep yourself protected emotionally from him theres no good which can come by arguing with a person who flips their positionlive as separately as possible from him and stick to roommate type matters such as groceries bill paying and housecleaning as discussion topicsif he cannot make sense of what he thinks and feels then certainly you will face similar difficulty trying to do so

my husband and i are separated he says he needs some time apart he says he needs to get back the in love part of a relationship but doesnt want to lose me should i wait or start over new its not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time it is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent if you and your husband have been together for quite some time its likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other while this is a good thing in some ways it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that in love feeling he is referring to couples simply become ambivalent for some of the couples i work with in my practice i find that helping to organize a time apart which i call a therapeutic separation can do wonders for the relationship i offer homework to be done during this time reading worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship it often times brings more appreciation for their partners when the pair comes back together we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before
my husband and i are separated he says he needs some time apart he says he needs to get back the in love part of a relationship but doesnt want to lose me should i wait or start over new thats a tough one would you and your husband be willing to attend couples counseling during the separation that would benefit you both if you separate and reconcile what will have changed other than you having time apart you will need to gain new skills to enhance and maintain your connection  otherwise you will risk repeating the cycle of disconnect discontentment and separation please seek help from a therapist trained in couples work to help the two of you find a way either back to each other or gracefully out of the marriage time away will not by itself change your relationship into one that can be sustained

i recently went through a divorce my exhusband called my sister saying bad things about me my sister never defended me now that i showed the truth shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning sorry for so much emotional pain from the combination of the divorce and your sister not supporting you in the way you wishwhen you feel ready and if you feel this would help then consider to talk to your sister from perspective to improve the relationship the two of you havesince the ex is gone and the sister is an ongoing person in your life this particular incident is only one in many which the two of you will have with each otherthe disappointment you feel now as to how she handled herself is a point to bring up to her for the sake of clarifying the type of relationship you each would like to build with each otheras to your specific question as to why she did what she did she is the only person who has the answerstart with finding out if she wants to improve the relationship altogether then you can use her lack of support with the ex as an example of how meaningful her support of you is to you
i recently went through a divorce my exhusband called my sister saying bad things about me my sister never defended me now that i showed the truth shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning unfortunately i cant tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that wayi can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved while the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics also a lot of people dont act the same way around extended family or other people as they do at home behind closed doors so there are times when divorce is a real shock to everyone who was not directly involved in iti wonder if you are at a place where you can shift your focus into looking at your relationship with your sister how she is treating you how you feel around her now etc i do not know how close you were before all of this and how close you feel now but perhaps if you can assess your overall relationship you could find a time when you could ask about this why she didnt convey that to him from the beginning in a way that is calm not defensive and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister not looking to defend yourself at that moment if that conversation can happen it may be quite a difficult one so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation its not about you but is about where she was coming from after you think you understand that im saying that you understand where shes coming from not that you agree with what shes saying you could see if shes willing to listen to how you feel about it
she said she needed space after three days of dating and she got a boyfriend a week later i still really miss her and she told me she still likes me given the short amount of time you know this girlfriend there is no history on which to make a judgment about the likelihood of what she will do nextcertainly she is confusing by telling you she likes you and is with someone new and not giving you any explanation as to why she made her decisionid suggest two possibilitiesspeak with her and ask her if she considers opening your relationship with heror simply wait and see what she does when you contact her in a friendly waypay attention to your own satisfaction levelif you get more answers from her which arent agreeable with you then it is time to put the hope for this relationship behind youthen youll have clear space to find someone who is as interested in you as you are in them
she said she needed space after three days of dating and she got a boyfriend a week later i still really miss her and she told me she still likes me it sounds as if your exgirlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you there are lots of levels of relationships from a basic acquaintance to a more friendly acquaintance to a friend close friend best friend early romantic partner committed romantic partner and many moreif she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but are what are called openended questions which ask her to provide more information during this process it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective after you have done this for five minutes its a rough estimate but basically until you can restate what she is saying and she says you have it right you can switch so she is asking you questions about how you are feeling the goal is not necessarily to change the outcome but to learn more about yourselves and each otherthen you may have an idea of where you stand in each others eyes
my exgirlfriend says shes bored and wants to experience life single i treated her really badly and caused meaningless fights when she didnt do anything i feel remorseful and im willing to do whatever it takes to get her back shes unhappy when i called her she was crying and said she will text me when shes ready were you happy with the ways she satisfied youa relationship is happiest if each partner concentrates on the happiness of the otherstrange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored rather than say they feel hurtis it possible you are being selfcritical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treatedsince shes putting up a barrier to communicating with you better for you to respect this than contact her by phone againconsider in a few weeks so each of you has time to think over your happiness with the other person to write her an email which states your interest to reopen the relationshipwho knows you may even decide by the end of a few weeks that youre fine without this particular relationshipdepending on her response to your email youll know whether and how much chance there is for the relationship to clear up the problems of the past and to continue
my fiancé and i broke up he cheated on me numerous times i kept forgiving but questioning his every move he got tired and left cheating on you shows a lack of commitment in addition to the emotional hurt it createsprobably you didnt actually forgive him because if you did then you wouldnt have been asking questions of his every movemaybe you were open to forgiving him in order for forgiveness to be effective the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in youfrom what you write your fiancé didnt seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected youit is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel of having to watch him all the timeas uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you
my fiancé and i broke up he cheated on me numerous times i kept forgiving but questioning his every move he got tired and left if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him however it takes time to heal your pain you are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you
my fiancé and i broke up he cheated on me numerous times i kept forgiving but questioning his every move he got tired and left there is a grieving process after losing a relationship or any other major loss such as a job a house etc one of the things to consider is give yourself a chance to go through the tasks of mourningto accept the reality of the lossto process the pain of griefto adjust to a world without the person who has just leftto find an enduring connection with that person in the midst of embarking on a new life this could mean a lot of things but it could be holding certain memories as your ownyou may also find things that make you feel happy or comfortable its also helpful to have people who you can talk to about your feelings and people who may be able to recognize things about you that you cannot see right now such as how you are honest committed to your work a good listener etcthis takes some time try to be gentle with yourself
i was in a relationship with a woman for four years we both made mistakes but i do love her she has moved in with another lady i think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her how can i find out for sure has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationshipfrom what you describe your former partner is in a new relationshipit is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again that you are misinterpreting your former partners actionsif youd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner is to contact her and ask her your questiona better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone elsesince she was meaningful to you respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didnt continue as you wished
my exfiancé whom i am still seeing left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters they wanted him to try to work it out with their mom his exgirlfriend of 20 years he and i split three months ago but i have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his exgirlfriend and kids he is coexisting for the kids and fighting all the time with his exgirlfriend his daughters dont want their dad with me because my two boys grown adults and on their own now had bad reputations and issues with drugs his daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me he and i had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels he is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to do the right thing and stay with his exgirlfriend for the kids he says he wants me to wait we were going get married last year he bought me a 1000 dress we had invitations made and everything set up but then his girls told him theyd never speak to him again if he married me he says hes trying to mend his relationship with them hello it seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you do you feel those circumstances are healthy do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty why do you continue to be in this situation without meaning to appear that i might be lacking in compassion you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you is there a benefit to being in this relationship do you consider this situation to be for your highest good is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional in truth only you can decide the answers to these very important questions i would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive in my clinical view based on what i read this particular relationship does not carry the joy i am sure you want nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another personbeating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose it likely will only lower your selfesteem there is a time to wait to see how things develop and a time to move on to other experiences you are the one to make that choice but i would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self for the most clear answer chances are you already know the answer you just need to embrace it getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here
this would be very unsettling for most peopleonce a relationship is finished then starting a relationship of only roommates would require to constantly be watchful to keep the relationship businesslike and friendly and avoid acting on any romantic or partner feelings toward the other personthe best situation would be if one of you would relocate because avoiding so many feelings on a long term basis creates a lot of tension
im not sure whether youre asking for help to cope with the relationship between you or feelings that you are havingthis may be a good time to talk about what kind of relationship you want to have whether friends just people who are sharing a living space etc and what boundaries you both have as far as personal space belongings conversation etc there are a lot of different pieces to consider and it may be helpful to take a day or two to consider the ways in which you typically interact and make a list of the things that you would like to discusswhen you are discussing whatever relationship you are going to have now consider taking the time to listen to how each of you feel and think about different things that are most important to you hearing the other persons point of view does not mean that you have to agree but just the you can see where theyre coming fromif you are asking how better to cope with your own feelings there can be a lot of different emotional reactions to a breakup it is certainly expected that you could have lots of feelings related to sadness nervousness anger and many other things having these emotions is okay if you find that it is difficult to eat or sleep beyond a few days or its difficult for you to follow through with other daily activities you may consider talking with a local therapist it can be helpful to have someone there to discuss thoughts and feelings that you have and be there to help you consider your next steps try to be patient with yourself as you work through this
yes you can move on from a relationship that ends abruptly with no explanation one way you can do this is by creating your own narrative around what happened chances are you were not fully getting what you wanted out of the relationship either he just happened to be the one that called it quits first start by sitting down with a journal and summarizing the time line of the relationship include both the good and bad the ups and downs when you get to the finale of your story you create the ending do not frame yourself as the victim think about what was most likely going on in his head usually there are clues that we might not see clearly until after the fact write about what you learned from the relationship and the positive growth you experienced be thankful that you were released from continuing any further with someone who was not meant to be your longterm partner but express gratefulness for the season and all you learned
ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost 3 years even though i care about him he continues to hurt me he and his wife were separated when we met now hes going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard i want to end this relationship but i dont feel like i can how can i let go hello and thank you for your question boy ending relationships is tough isnt it sometimes its tough even when we are 100 sure that it is the right thing to doi am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others one of the things that i want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing in other words its not really something you can reach out and grab its more of a process this is good news because you dont necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship we just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over for example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their anniversary this could make the person very sad they may even regret ending the relationship for a little while it would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it this is relevant for you its hard to walk away from a relationship we fear all kinds of things including being single sometimes its helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship its helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship its fine to admit uncertainly about ending things its okay to be afraid its okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt and even with all of that someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them they can have sadness later on and still not go backit sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce the truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship there would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce sometimes not making decisions stresses us out a lot more than making a decision and living with the consequences both good and bad you may be at that crossroads be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost 3 years even though i care about him he continues to hurt me he and his wife were separated when we met now hes going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard i want to end this relationship but i dont feel like i can how can i let go first decide what you truly would like in the current relationship understand your reasons for staying in the relationshipthree years is a substantial amount of time to be involved with someone whatever attachment you feel toward this man is deep and complexinstead of deciding to leave or not leave change your question to figuring out your satisfactions and dissatisfaction with the man also important is to tell the man your feelingswhatever problem you are feeling may become clarified by discussing what bothers youat the very least you will give the guy a chance to show how interested he actually is in the tension you currently feel and have felt for a while
i was in a relationship for almost five years we were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship he was a caring friendly and charming guy up until three and a half years in he started controlling me who i hung out with where i was at all times and he had a huge hissy fit if i tried to ask him the same questions all that time he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my socalled friends at the end he was a nasty and narcissistic person now its hard to be social it sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people it is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with otherstherapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want often relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship

my husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me hes been talking about divorce but he hasnt filed now he has a girlfriend and he abandoned me and his kids he has no financial help and he has been out of the home for four months he became very angry and mean he says its all my fault and that were not compatible its hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage could be but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more
my husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me and i moved out he is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right im not sure if i trust that he will not go back to his old ways i am glad he is seeing a counselor that is something that most men struggle with doing at times time will tell if his actions are of good intentions however remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships what part did you play did you down play his disrespect at one time did you give up the power of your own voice did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided did you allow him to make you doubt yourself in others words if you do decide to give him another chance what would you do different not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words at all but dont allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future if you do decide to give it another try go in with a voice with the demand of respect with your needs and wants expressed and expected with an increase in your self worth and confidence you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self
my exboyfriend boyfriend and i lived together he had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her one was an abortion another was a miscarriage and then she had the third baby they are not together but he continues to contact me and wants me back he has nothing to offer me hi atticathis is a question i think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them in your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you for some people honestly its a game to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you if you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour remind yourself why you dont want to be with them i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me thats great selftalkbut lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this sometimes its because we still hope they will change maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days the problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less so what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of people do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life this is a normal but not a healthy thought its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes you deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused if you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better it will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursdraw a line their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance
my husband and i got into a huge dispute he said he wanted a divorce and i left i still come home a lot and see my kids and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is what does that mean for our marriage in any relationship including marriage each partner will be better able to do their part by understanding their own interests and wishesconcentrate more on what youd like from your marriage this will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of himthink over whether you wish to divorce or notsince he hasnt taken any action then for the moment you can assume he is not sure of what he wantsonce you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage including feeling uncertain if youd like it to end or continue then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotionstry to redirect your speculations about what does he want i wonder what hes thinking back to answering these very reasonable questions about yourselfthis will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with himgood luck
my husband and i got into a huge dispute he said he wanted a divorce and i left i still come home a lot and see my kids and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is what does that mean for our marriage in situations like this in most cases he probably will not fill anytime soon its more of the fact that he isnt ready to give that life yet now if you probably pressured him about it then yes he would probably give in but if it hasnt been a big issue anymore or something you guys arent talking about then right now everything is on a hold
in 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and weve been separated ever since we have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others i stopped because i wanted my marriage to work out but he did not if he stops sleeping with other women can our marriage be saved or should we just part ways i still care deeply about him after all that i did and he has done but he is seeing someone else on and off for years now will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship there is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriagealso positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or notwhether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other oneis sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husbandlove and care are not enough to make a marriage work partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other that you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband it intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship toodecide how much emotional sadness and hurt youre willing to tolerate and the reason youre willing to do sofrom what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for thisif your husband doesnt start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so

im a teenager and i just got my first job i am a month and a half in yesterday my boss pushed me to the point where i had to go to the restroom and cry she didnt see me and im glad but when i went to talk to her about it today i let a tear or two come out i hate it i feel like theyre not going to keep me anymore getting your first job is an exciting terrifying and challenging experience it is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker you are literally learning as you go in this completely new environment you are going to make mistakes you are not going to get it right the first time it can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work a couple of things to remember here 1 you are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it 2 there is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work 3 you know best what you need in order to be successful these three items can be helpful to remember especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully if you feel like your supervisor is approachable meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you let them know you are nervous about doing a good job also let them know how you learn new tasks information or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand becoming a successful worker doesnt happen overnight but each day you can identify what works for you and what doesnt by communicating with your work team the easier it will be for you we all had a first job once and were all worried about doing well hang in there and call a counselor if you need more help

my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that im doing things she finds disrespectful even when i dont mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her she doesnt and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand hello that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified it may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsthe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of im sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says im sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating for

i am in a high stress position for a tech company i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety but also demoralizing
what can i do to manage my stress i think its important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress it is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid you will not perform well as you mention and thus your selfesteem will continually take a hit without really any effort so i dont know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first stepyou dont speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better because we exist as a part of a relationship with everything including people at our job i would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss often overworked and underpaid also includes the my boss never notices me and that can demoralizing if we feel appreciated that can go a long way ive found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees appreciation and it goes deeper than thank you or taking you out to lunch  its almost something felt as opposed to made explicitbut sometimes appreciation isnt going to do the trick either because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel burnout you have zero interest in doing the job in the way it is designed so some real changes need to be implemented the bottom line try not to just suck it up and do all of the self care work on your own if your company isnt helping you to take care of yourself im talking to you boss that handles employee pay andor work conditions then you also have to question if this is a company worth working for while i dont know exactly what you do it sounds like you have confidence in your contributions so take that confidence to a tech company that will support you and there are tech companies out there

what can i do to manage my stress first look at your own history at times past trauma can make the current situation worse if you have ever experienced trauma you may want to try addressing the traumatic experience directly so that you can see clearly to deal with the current situationin addition consider how your current boss coworkers andor company may be similar to your home life as a child is your boss or the company like one or both of your parents is a coworker similar to a family member could you be perceiving a workrelated situation or a person at work the same as a family member because their words actions or looks remind you of that person ultimately after asking yourself these questions and providing honest answers it will help you to determine whether you are dealing with issues of the past or whether you are in a current toxic work enviornment from there you can decide what you want for your future

i am in a high stress position for a tech company i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety but also demoralizing
what can i do to manage my stress ugh we spend so many hours at work so if its a tough environment it can really drag you down is this your dream job gone sour or a just pay the bills deal that has gotten stale it makes a big difference in terms of next stepsfor example if this job is a step on the way to a bigger goal it might be time to assess whether you need to be moving along to then next phase have you learned what you needed to learn to make this a helpful experience or do you sense there is more to learn but you feel stuck in some way if this current job is part of a bigger plan then you need to practice some good self care set up ways to remind yourself why you are doing what you are doing and make sure you are including some carrots along the way that might mean spending some time each week networking preferably live but online works well too with peers in similar situations entrepreneur groups skill building trainings etc big dreams require small steps but we all need support along the wayif  however this is just a job then you really have to reassess your situation if you are burned out and not getting paid your worth then look around for other opportunities you are employed not owned you mentioned anxiety and while i dont want to minimize the very real issues anxiety presents is it possible that some of your anxiety can be seen as revving your engine and readying you to move on or is it that pervasive feeling of never being able to finish your work feeling like you will be in trouble or dreading every single moment of your workday the first is a potentially positive motivator the second is just bad for you see the differencein order to feel any satisfaction with your job it needs to be financially rewarding to a level that makes sense be a good atmosphere to learn be supportive andor be a step on the way to a bigger plan you have if your job isnt fulfilling any of those criteria you need to move on and finally if the only reason you have this job is to pay the bills and you truly see no way around keeping your current position for now remember why you are there  this is a job not a family you rent your brain and body to your employer not your heart and soul those belong to you and you are responsible for feeding them that means good selfcare making sure you have social engagement facetoface not just online move your body feel the sun on your face daily creating ways to refresh your body and mind and generally taking care of your whole beingdiscomfort exists for a reason  it primes us for change gives us the necessary motivation to take reasonable risks and pesters us until we do so the first step is to figure out what change is realistic and take action

my boss took over some work id begun concerned that she had doubts about my work i asked her for feedback i assured her that i did my utmost for customer service and asked if i was deficient she then said this was me being codependent your boss response was insensitiveeither you can assume she was careless in her remark to you because of some unusual pressure in her own day and ask for feedback at a different time on a different projector if you dont want to take your chances of being insulted again then be your own evaluator of how well you did your workassume your work was at least good enough otherwise she would have pointed out any mistakes

ive worked with this guy for about three years now and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted over time he became a very dear friend and we talked about our relationship problems family dreams and so on there was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out we agreed to keep it quiet and we did but in the back of my mind i hoped it would become something more it didnt and three months later im still not over it
im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants were no longer in the same office which i thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so im still very drawn to him hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested hes younger than me and prefers model types but i see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship it sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations  which is understandable on the one hand you want to get over him on the other you are still holding out hope for something more it will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more if you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system  that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him if you are wholeheartedly committed to moving past the sexual and romantic parts of your relationship and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start it is hard to just be friends when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins

i am conflicted with this guy i work with he is a coworker and close friend whom ive had a crush on since meeting him four years ago we made out once after years of flirting i was hoping for more but nothing happened i distanced myself a lot after hello emotions run high in crush situations and when emotions run high its not uncommon for us to have emotionbased instead of factbased thoughts after reading your question i wondered how you went from making out to nothing happened i wondered if this happened because of an emotionbased thought that sounded like if he liked me he would make something happen a truer and more empowering thought might be i want something different to happen with him and i want to take a different action to see if that can happen this thought focuses more on the one thing you can control you hopefully the thought also empowers you to think through what you can do to gauge interesttalk with him about his feelings on the matter i hope this helps and good luck to you
i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs his coworker sent him an inappropriate video he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that the offspring are your propertyif you require that no other man show inappropriate content to them then require compensation for use and enjoyment of your property without your consentsend them a billwhen they do not pay it activate the local sheriff take them to small claims court and win a judgment against them for failure to compensate for the use and enjoyment of your propertyi wonder what might happen after that learn to act as man  and watch the magic happen
i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs his coworker sent him an inappropriate video he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that from what you write it sounds like youre reaching quite far into your childs fathers way to handle his friendshipstheres a difference between an agreement between you and the childs father to not view porn and with you monitoring and setting standards for your childs fathers way to handle his social lifetry to accept the limits of your request extends to you and the childs father not the way the childs father wants to handle his relationships with other peoplealso pushing too hard or setting your expectations of the childs father too wide for him to tolerate may end up backfiring on youwho knows maybe hell decide enough is enough and withdraw from the otherwise reasonable agreement to not watch porn
i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs his coworker sent him an inappropriate video he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that in my book this is a boundary issue although you do not like inappropriate content it is not up to you what your childs father looks at or what his friend sends him it is really hard not to monitor other peoples lives but in the end your rights begin and end with you
i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs his coworker sent him an inappropriate video he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that it sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child this situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child
ive been suppressing it for quite some time but there are days when i cant make eye contact with her i think she knows and we both admitted there was some type of vibe but the overall discussion was vague i think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us its driving me crazy as an act of expression i have purchased a gift for her thats personalized i havent given it to her yet there are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace
ive been suppressing it for quite some time but there are days when i cant make eye contact with her i think she knows and we both admitted there was some type of vibe but the overall discussion was vague i think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us its driving me crazy as an act of expression i have purchased a gift for her thats personalized i havent given it to her yet human attractions can be tricky things and in this case  a power dynamic in the workplace a boss usually has the power to hire fire set schedules approve vacations and evaluate performance because of this power dynamic most employee handbooks expressly forbid supervisors and their direct employees being in a romantic relationship perhaps you should check your employee handbook it is possible that if you or your supervisor act on your feelings one of you might have to be reassigned or if no reassignment is available asked to resign while you may be attracted to your boss and your feelings may be strong it might be in your best interests to resist acting upon them
i was having a sexual relationship with a coworker he decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend before i got paid i told him i would have 2500 which i thought i would but when i saw my paycheck i could not pay the 2500 he says i lied to him about it he wants me to reimburse him 2500 for the hotel room he decided to get he stayed at the hotel and i left i dont think its right that he want me to reimburse him 2500 for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place he is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me i am a liar and that i should never said i was going to have 2500 when i knew i wasnt i told him i had to pay rent and my rent was late he texted me saying i need to get two or three jobs hello and thank you for your question it really is up to you to decide if you owe him the 2500 if you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him then pay when you can i am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over 2500 i know that it can be a lot of money if you dont have much but that doesnt give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts you may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
my coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss saying i have mood swings they have no proof to back it up can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice if this is a concern of a few coworkers make sure it is not something they see but you dont admit to employers can suggest or something stipulate in continued employment with them for you to go to their employment assistance provider eap if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships no one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile employers can be held responsible if they do not take actioncouple of things you can doask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is trueseek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist
my coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss saying i have mood swings they have no proof to back it up can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice i cant give you legal advice but employers can suggest you see someone if your behavior is affecting your job i believe most government agencies have an employee assistance program eap where employees can talk to a therapist about any issue not just workrelated for free up to a certain amount of sessionsim wondering though why your coworkers would tell your boss this if its not true is it possible that youre not aware of how your interactions are affecting others maybe this forced counseling can be an opportunity for some introspection on your part
it absolutely is a real thing work can take a significant toll on a person in many ways there are several things you can do to manage burnout at work depending on your specific work environment some of these might be more realistic than others it may help to set firm boundaries between your work life and your personal life also it often help s to create some variation in your work schedule or work tasks at times burnout can also stem from a lack of challenge at work feelings of being burned out by work might be a sign that its time for a change

maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies as in matthew 77 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you although i minister in interfaith jesus also mentions about how he lives within all of us as in the beginning when the solar system was created in dark matter we are created in the image of to better understand ourselves your soul journey the date and time life breathed into your physical part while understand that we animate the physical faith and belief is a choice suggestion  order a life path report it helps you learn more about you educate and seek spiritual advisors to help you connect to the spirit talking about it helps
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies since no one can prove that there is a higher power meaning we cannot observe god with our senses the decision to believe is a choice you make when something cant be proven true you get to choose what belief system works best for you some questions to reflect on might be1 what does god even mean what are the experiences that have shaped your perception of god are there any other ways to think of it2 what turns you on or off to the idea of god and remember that there is a difference between religion and spirituality you do not have to be religious to believe in god3 how might your life look if you truly believed there was a higher powergod how might that be beneficial why wouldnt you believe what is there to lose4 how might your life look if you chose not to believe in any higher power is there anything you might lose what would you gain5 how do you cope with things that are outside of your control and dont make sense how do you cope with the idea of death and tragedyif you decide that you would like to cultivate a belief in god then there are ways you can strengthen this belief some doubt and questioning is always normal something you could do to strengthen your belief is to look for ways that it fits into your life look for things that have happened in your life that show you there is somethingsomeone out there looking out for you another way to think about god is to think about love not in the emotional sense of the word but in terms of good versus evil light versus dark love versus hate there are some things out there that are clearly evil acts christians refer to this as the enemy and sin but many times something good can be found amidst the bad as fred rogers once said whenever you see something terrible that happened on the news look for the helpers you will always find people who are helping and as one of my favorite verses from the bible goes light always overcomes darknessremember the answers youre looking for come from within just look for the answers you hope to find and they will come to you
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies there are an infinite number of ways to look at this spirituality religion god higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people my question for you is what does real actually mean to you often the concept of god has to do with what you believe in if you ask 1000 different people youll probably get almost that many different answersconsider talking with friends or family about this i would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do you may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure the local salvation army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services there may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussionjust a word of caution in my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others when initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinionsas far as whether god is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies thanks for posting this is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless among other emotions due to the uncertainty you said that at times you feel like everyone is lying ask yourself some of these questions what is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying where is the concrete evidence that they are lying how could i test my thoughts about this what if things are not what they seem on the surface am i any lesser of a person as a result of this persons behavior or opinion our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave it is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions you can start this process by answering some of the above questions we are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with as it pertains to if god is a lie be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that god is or is not real it may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that hope this helps at least a little bit
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies the way that i see it is that humans have always been afraid of life and death historically we have always tried to understand life we try to organize it categorize it explore it and weve built up this system our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and death is this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements it is no matter how you try to argue it a false system of conditioning humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be god has been developed over time as a security blanket for our childlike selves the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way on earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought economics societal structures and so on it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at baskinrobbins so then i ask you which one is real and what is real
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies it is not a stupid question it is very basic to help answer your question let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof with that being said one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly if one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable then there must be a guiding force and plan may you be successful in your journey
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies your question is actually thoughtful and reflects a true interest to know more about lifeno one knows if god is a lie because god is a concept in which people either make up their own definition of this concept or believe one of the concepts of what god is handed down by religionsall the religions exclude the other god concepts and expect loyalty to believing in their particular version of godprobably god is real in the sense that most people want to believe there is guided purpose to what goes on in lifethis is as definite as what we can know about godgod is not a lie because it is not a fact beliefs arent provable
maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies believing in god is a matter of faith there are many opinions out there for and against gods existence but the real question is not if god is real or not but do you want to have faith and decide that he exists this is a personal choice reading scripture may help to learn more about those who struggle with believing but again you decide if you believe that scripture is true or not praying and asking for a revelation or a confirmation may help as well but again it is another act of faith estoy teniendo dificultad con la idea de dios es real o notal vez es una pregunta estúpida pero algunas veces no sé que es real o no siento que todo el mundo miente cómo se si dios es una de esas mentirascreer en dios es una cuestión de fe hay muchas opiniones en favor y en contra de la existencia de dios pero la verdadera pregunta no es si dios existe pero si tu quieres creer que existe esto es una decisión muy individual leer la biblia te puede ayudar a conocer sobre algunas personas que han dudado pero de nuevo tu decides si las escrituras son reales para ti orar y pedir una revelación o confirmación es otro acto de fe que te puede ayudar

there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal
river the current of the river swept silently over them all  young and
old rich and poor good and evil  the current going its own way knowing
only its own crystal self
each creature in its own
manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging
was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned
from birth
but one creature said
at last i am tired of clinging though i cannot see it with my eyes
i trust that the current knows where it is going i shall let go and let
it take me where it will clinging i shall die of boredom
the other creatures laughed
and said fool let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled
and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredom
but the one heeded them
not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed
by the current across the rocks
yet in time as the creature
refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and
he was bruised and hurt no more
and the creatures downstream
to whom he was a stranger cried see a miracle a creature like ourselves
yet he flies see the messiah come to save us all
and the one carried in
the current said i am no more messiah than you the river delights to
lift us free if only we dare let go our true work is this voyage this
adventure
but they cried the more
savior all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again
he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a savior
my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before he is having a hard time accepting my past especially that im not a virgin he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others his insecurities are hurting our relationship how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present your patience with his pace of accepting your past is the factor most in your control in this situationeveryone accepts a new understanding at their own particular rate yours may be faster than his pacesince it is possible he may accelerate his pace of accepting your past if he knows that this is a priority for you tell him about your own discomfort even if knowing how you feel does not motivate him to a quicker pace of accepting your past you will have the peace of mind to know you gave him all the information you possibly had to give
my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before he is having a hard time accepting my past especially that im not a virgin he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others his insecurities are hurting our relationship how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present sometimes we have difficulty keeping the past in the past the best way to build a great relationship and have a great future believe it or not is to be firmly placed in the present that means that when we stay in the moment with our partner and can notice what we are experiencing in the here and now we reap the best benefits of that relationship we notice the good things that are happening in the moment we are reacting to what we are experiencing in the moment not reacting to a worry about the past we notice especially who the person is right now and not who they were in the past we can connect with the things we love about them tooi think it is great that you want to help him and the choice to stay in the present and move forward in the relationship will mostly be up to him we cannot change another person it sounds like couples counseling might be a great step for you because you can both learn the skills you need to stay in the present and also learn some helpful active listening skills so that you can really listen to one another and understand each other communication skills can really be helpful you can both have the opportunity to hear each other and support each other we cannot change the past but we can create the future we wantbest of luck to you both
my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before he is having a hard time accepting my past especially that im not a virgin he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others his insecurities are hurting our relationship how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present one of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself but you cant make goals for your partner if your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction you can certainly assist him but you cant independently make it happeni wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five 10 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening kind of like an investigative reporter so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean when it feels like to to him when this is discussed etc at that point maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as wellalso if he wants to make a change it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached so it is often helpful to have someone there to assistit may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued appreciated special or loved and also consider what makes your fiancé feel that way

i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do hello this is a really tough question and there are no easy answers to this however i can recommend that first of foremost it is important that you learn to accept yourself this is easier said than done and i can acknowledge and validate that sentiment all to well i have worked with clients such as yourself who struggle to learn how to accept themselves in the face of what appears to be insurmountable obstacles nevertheless it is possible it begins with finding a good counselor who can walk with you through this journey to selfacceptance i cannot and neither can anyone guarantee that your family will change and accept you although i have seen in my work with clients like yourself where the family has moved from intolerance to tolerance with the ultimate goal of acceptance it does not mean that some change is possible as stated earlier i highly recommend that you talk with a counselor psychologist psychotherapist etc who specializes in this area
i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do i understand that this must be a difficult time for you with
many adjustments if you feel comfortable enough to ask your parents to see a
life coach or a therapist this may be an excellent place to start you dont
need to tell them the reason why maybe say that you simply need someone to talk
to for support with school or homework etc the life coach or therapist would
be the optimal person to advise you on how to proceed with providing support
and guidance there may be someone at your school whom you could talk to for
confidential support and guidance as well be confident in the fact that you
are not alone and there are always responsible adults available to guide you
through any difficult process you may experience in life talking to family
about personal issues can be difficult for anyone even adults i recommend
getting help from a trusted professional adult before you decide what to do

i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do spirituality for those in the lgbtq community can be one of the more difficult roads unfortunately many unjustly ostracize members of the lgbtq community away from faith and spirituality i believe that folks can embrace the identity that is genuine to them and still maintain their spiritual beliefs briefly the keys are to first monitor how we allow those in our life to influence our thoughts and emotions we need to create standards and boundaries to protect ourselves we also need to not project the judgment of other people onto our individual spiritual beliefs there are many ways in which to tackle this effort
i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do ultimately to suppress your natural identity will work against youhowever difficult painful frightening it is to tell your family about your discovery about who you are trying to avoid your own truth will do you harm eventuallyone way to make this conversation easier for yourself is to prepare yourself for the outcomes you expect and know will be difficulttake as much time as you need to accept the potential rejection because this way iff and when it comes you will be better able to handle it
i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do first of all i want to say i am so sorry you are not feeling accepted by your family i know how isolating and lonely this can be the most important step you can take right now is building a community of supportive people who do accept you creating your own sense of community is very powerful for helping you love yourself if you can find a trans support or lgbtq support group in your area i recommend seeking that out right away through your local lgbtq center or pflag if you dont have access to that i recommend calling trans lifeline us 8775658860 canada 8773306366 httpswwwtranslifelineorg you can talk to other transidentified people anonymously for support calling them from wherever you feel safe this is a great way to begin to connect with other people who have similar experiences to you next think of this time in your life as your time to explore your gender identity just for yourself make room to explore you gender identity in ways that are private and comfortable for you consider reading a book like httpswwwnewharbingercomqueerandtransgenderresilienceworkbook to explore who you are and build resilience also consider learning about other religions that are accepting of lgbtq folks for another perspective  there are many out there once you feel you have a strong support system outside of your family and a positive sense of selflove which can take time be patient dont rush it then you can consider what action steps you want to take with your family if you are still living with your family or financially depend on them having other supports in place first is very important its a very personal choice how you want to navigate your family relationships talk it through indepth with a trusted friend other trans folks or therapist to help you decide whats right for youand remember there are tons of people out there who will love and accept you we are rooting for youin solidaritylindsey
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am what exactly is it that you are looking for different people define themselves in different ways for example one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics still another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience at the same time who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have this may help you to know more about what you value what you like and dislike and what you want for yourself in life best of luck to you
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am this is perhaps the deepest question that one can ask of themselves and the answer is as elusive as the deepest enigma we are fluid beings we are never the same from day to day we learn or unlearn we evolve or some of us even devolve we are in a state of constant flux changing and adapting like a cloud in the sky that has its shape changed by the wind life whittles us away and carves us constantly trying to understand this question is like trying to bite your own teeth however we can have a sense of what we would call our core and to understand the core we need to live and to experience but also to think deeply analytically and critically by engaging with life we get a sense that we are like the earth itself inside of us there is a core just as there is inside our planet but our continents shift and change over time like those continents so does our own nature shift throughout our lives
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am because you put this under the category of spirituality im not sure whether you are asking how you find yourself as far as religious or spiritual beliefs or overallif you are talking about learning more about religious or spirituality consider either going to or speaking with someone who is involved with a nondenominational church service the salvation army usually has something so you can discuss questions or ideas that you may haveas far as finding yourself in general i suggest considering what makes you happy andor comfortable i also wonder if looking at the list of values here may be helpful to you httpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarification
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am this quiet wonder that you have is something you can easily explore there is a part of you that you can access anytime anywhere it is the part that has always been with you find a quiet place where you can be alone for a while and get comfortable settle in let your thoughts go by like a river stay with that connection for a while what you find in the silence is yours alone your you
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am the older i get the more i believe that our real task isnt to find ourselves were already 100 there what we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive most happy most creative and most fully engaged with life it is in those moments that we find ourselvesfor example i couldnt help loving the people or things i loved no matter who tried to talk me out of them all i needed to do was notice when my heart opened and i felt the most alivenot because i was afraid or addicted but because in those moments i was in contact with my highest self on the flip side i needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in methe ones that made me feel controlled constricted dishonest resentful or afraidand be honest about them mindfulness of what already is is the key to finding yourself align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you dont let old habits crappy jobs or meanspirited people define you just stumble your way forward as best you can with greater selfawareness followed by affirmative action
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am three years ago i attended a week long meditation retreat by the fifth day i noticed i was light headed and felt very strange i began to realize within my own being an experience of no separation i would see others at the retreat and smile i loved them all i could feel the connection with this awareness i had read about but never truly understood until that moment i remember understanding all the teachings i had learned throughout my life about a god who existed outside of me i realized i had all these answeres within my own being and so did everyone else i began to see everyone as not just capable but powerful loving beings since this experience it has been my desire for everyone to become conscious within whatever experience they wish i do this in many ways at our studio we combine mental health with yoga and meditation as well as nutrition counseling to help people come to their optimal selves to truly come into a state of finding yourself is to start to know and own who you are from a state of solid being in this there is nothing new under the sun and it is very simple i would love to teach you and anyone interested in coming into a state of awake conciousness the more awake we are the more joyful we are i live in this state of being and demonstrate it in my daily life
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am therapy may be an effective way for you to get a stronger sense of who you are a competent therapist will work to create a safe and curious therapeutic relationship in which you can explore your identity there are also many different exercises which you can do in and out of therapy which you may find helpful in this area as well
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am start by giving yourself enough quiet and time to remember about yourself what feels steady and consistent in your nature and interactions with othersgive yourself the freedom to your interest in having interests are you motivated because of competing with others or because an activity itself feels satisfyingif you are able to develop a sense of defining yourself without fear of judging yourself you will start coming close to knowing who you are
i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am im having the same issue i think you need to consider your morals and what you really want out of life if theres something you want to achieve thats who you are and you need to put yourself into that and immerse yourself in the purpose of whatever you want it doesnt matter how small it may seem if theres nothing you want badly then think about other things what others want or what you need or what others need find something that feels important and commit to it
im so sorry you lost your mom grief is a tough process usually the pain from loss doesnt go away but changes in ways that are manageable for your life when most people lose someone others offer a lot of support after a while that support tapers off even though your need for support doesnt its important to identify people or resources that can be there for you when you are still hurting do you have anyone in your life that is pretty constant there are also many grief support groups online eg httpswwwgriefshareorg and are usually some in person depending on your area these may be temporarily discontinued due to the covid19 situation though they may be doing these groups online as a way to offset the social distancing requirementsi know nothing about what your relationship with your mom was the manner in which she passed or how old you are but many times that can come with some pretty complicated emotions i also dont know if you lost your mom through deathsome people lose a parent via abandonment or a disease such as dementia no matter what the situation is whatever pain shows up for you is completely ok many people feel much more than sadness especially if the relationship with their loved one was problematic or if the loss was unexpected or traumatic its normal to feel intense anger guilt feelings of disbelief even happiness or relief grief does not have the same path for everyone and whatever path you are on is not wrongwhen i work with a client that has had a significant loss there are a number of things i may work on with them one is letter writing this isnt for everybody and some people need support and guidance with this sometimes there are things we feel have been unsaid and it can provide a sense of closure for some people it helps feel connected to that person again closure is not necessary to be able to move through grief but it can be helpful if the client feels it would be useful we also try to find a way to honor that person that may be through talking about them having a monthly or yearly ritual or carrying on a tradition they enjoyed it also depends on the culture you come from as well many different cultures have different beliefs about death and loss and the ways they think of or honor their loved one stick with what you feel speaks to your heartof course a counselor who specializes in grief may be a great option you can find someone in your area or online in your specific state that has the training for that counselors without that specialization may also be able to provide you some helpi dont know any counselors who havent had training in this area counselors are usually happy to answer your questions about their qualificationsi hope this helps you find some support

im a christian teenage girl and i have lost my virginity my boyfriend is a christian teenager too but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner i planned to abstain from sex but i guess i wasnt clear about this because i was also tempted and led him on we continued to have sex does it mean that he isnt the one god planned for me were so young but that doesnt stop me from dreaming of a potential future together i really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason im incredibly happy for i was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him i love him very much im not a super religious person but i cant imagine that if you love him that much and you want him that much that he wouldnt be the one for you because of something small like that sex is an act of love and commitment if you feel that you want to be with this person for the rest of your life want to marry them then why should you have to wait until marriage if you truly feel that this is the person you want to be with then why would you need to wait until marriage if youre just showing commitment to each other
im a young adult woman and i have trouble finding my true identity being at home this all started when i had a boyfriend about 10 months ago my boyfriend and i were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts at the time i was pretty religious but i let this happen i dont know why i felt kind of guilty but mostly because i know my parents wouldnt like it my parents are very religioustheyre christians we did things every time hed come over to my house we didnt have anything to do at our house so we would get tempted to do things when wed watch movies by ourselves
one day my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages as soon as my dad found this out he told my mom they were both aggravated they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants they said he wanted me for sex and hes not a christian i took their advice and broke up with him once we broke up for about a month i decided to get back together with him a little after school started my parents found out eventually and i decided to not listen this time i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him hows hes not the right one for me and god totally forbids him i would kind of try to break up with him and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents theyre always yelling at me about how i shouldnt date this boy i felt too old to listen to them now im kind of just stuck is the real me religious have i been brainwashed by him i dont talk to my parents anymore about him and my parents think im deceiving because of it they threatened me that if im still with him i cant do track and they wont support me theyve also called me slut and now they called me basically a devil worshipper they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents im actually very happy with him they also say im living a separate life at home than i am at school they say they want whats best for me and love me because they adopted me what a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you i would say the first thing you want to do is if you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward you unfortunately will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents it always helps to try and see things from another angle you might want to for example try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively are you living with your parents and do they support you if so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that best of luck to you
in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs i think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction there are many families that are united despite their differences for example a mother may be catholic and the father jewish by introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial also its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences so dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential
in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs you have an opportunity but you havent described a problem are you creating one many families have various members who have different spiritual beliefs and religious practices accepting the idea that those with whom we are close may be different from us is the only way to create a world of peace this may be a wonderful opportunity to practice tolerance and love if mutual decisions need to be made in religious contexts you may also get to practice boundary setting assertiveness without aggression communication skills and loving kindness this is a great problem to work through it is indeed a very spiritual question blessings to you all mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg

how can i get my life back there is a modality developed by pia mellody called post induction therapy pit the work has been continued by jan bergstrom who wrote the book gifts from a challenging childhood the premise of the work is that you can reparent those wounded parts of you a quote from jans book is if its hysterical its historical ive done this sort of work myself and its been hugely beneficial for my relationship the idea is when triggered by my partner im going to request space and affirm validate and even love that younger part of myself thats hurting and remind them that i as the functional adult i am can handle my partner basically im practicing getting in a more centered space and thus im able to be more relational this is a practice but the idea is to provide some separation from the trigger and an automatic reaction you can do it especially if you love him and hes worth it

how can i get my life back im so sorry that you have been haunted by the past for so long it must have been incredibly difficult to open up about something so dark and vulnerable but by shedding light on it you have already taken the first step toward healing trauma can wreak havoc on relationships if it isnt healed in fact we are all reacting to things every day based on perceptions colored by our past experiences the good news is you can heal by gaining an understanding of how trauma from the past is affecting you now developing healthy coping skills and working through those memories and emotions with a therapist this will require some rewiring of the brain meaning that you will identify the negative thought patterns and beliefs and replace them with something more helpful for example if your negative reaction feels like im abandoned and alone you might work on changing it to i can get my needs met and ill be okay regardless or if you find yourself feeling like im not worthy of love you might change that to something like i deserve to be lovedmost likely the reason youre pushing this man away is because something about this relationship is triggering negative beliefs and emotions from the past and your reaction by pushing him away protects you in some way even though there may not be any real danger now you probably know this logically but trauma gets stuck in our emotional mind which you cant reason with thats why you have to work through the emotions to be able to see things more clearly from a new and more helpful perspective i like to think of emotions like clouds that block the sun and make it difficult to see anything clearly if we ignore and avoid the clouds all the time then we will spend our lives looking at the ground if you can learn to safely weather the storm youll find that before long it will pass and youll be able to see things clearly againi recommend working with a therapist who is trained in treating trauma and who you feel comfortable with because they will be able to tailor treatment to your specific needs you can have the happy life and healthy relationship you desire and deserve

how can i get my life back im going to second that it is completely brave of you to share something you kept hidden for over 30 years thats a huge dealsomething awesome about the brain is that it can learn at any time in the human lifespan no matter how long you have dealt with the affects of trauma your brain has potential to rewire and change how it operates this is just my assumption but it sounds like you are just realizing the impact the trauma has had and is continuing to have on your life first of all thats phenomenal informationmany people spend their lives blind to these influences and may never get help on the other hand it can be super overwhelming to now have all this insight about yourself and not know how to deal with it its ok to feel that uncertainty andor stress about the processthats totally expected and will most likely feel less powerful the more you move through healingi understand your fears about pushing away someone you care about and that seems important to you thats quite a normal behavior as a result of childhood trauma when we are first learning our relationship to others and the world as children trauma can teach us that others are unsafe or may hurt us almost all my clients have experienced childhood trauma and one of the things we spend time exploring is what they may be trying to protect themselves from by pushing others away vulnerability can be scary for everybody but why specifically is it scary for you i bet theres a really logical reasonits unclear how long youve known this man and how connected you feel to him but could he potentially be a support person for you if you feel uncomfortable with that that doesnt mean anything bad it just means you arent ready its not easy to talk about such hard things it does seem like you know that you behave in ways that push him awaywhat would your behavior look like if you didnt that doesnt mean sharing everything or no boundaries but meeting him somewhere in the middle sometimes the brain needs evidence that being vulnerable doesnt always equate to danger or rejectionas others have noted a counselor can help if you so choose to go that route i cant say what your journey will look like but i already have so much hope for you since you are obviously incredibly courageous and motivated to work to make your life better if 8 year old you can make it through trauma then 40 year old you can definitely work through this

how can i get my life back you already are doing that you are reaching out virtually still counts you are accepting your past you are not denying what happened to you you are talking about the past you are already doing a great job of starting this journey you get your life back by doing things differentlyi would think about how you would like to process your past do you want to talk to someone do you want to write about it do you want to pray about it do you want to read and research books about trauma take some time and think about what you want to do think about what would work for you and dive in i am a licensed professional counselor so i am biased  but i really believe that counseling works having an objective professional voice that can guide you on this process is so valuable but please choose what makes you feel comfortable  not what everyone else says i think you are very brave for reaching out and wanting to work on this that takes a tremendous amount of courage and strength

i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this so believe it or not this is actually very common first off take a deep breath it does not mean that youre a sociopath all it means is that your brain has shifted into survival mode for a time and might need a little support to get back to normal our brain can play tricks on us after a trauma one thing that most people experience is the desire to push away or to avoid reminders of the trauma which include feelings of anxiety guilt anger fear and sometimes shame and if you think about it thats entirely understandable who would want to feel those yucky feelings or to be reminded of the trauma but here is the catch the more we try to push those unpleasant emotions away the more we are actually pushing away our ability to experience positive feelings emotions such as happiness excitement or closeness with loved ones become increasingly difficult to access most trauma survivors will experience this emotional blunting and is actually one of the things we look for when giving a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorderbut there is good news specialized trauma therapy using evidencebacked approaches can help us to experience the emotions were trying to push away in a safe environment its like our brain needs to fully digest what happened in order to return to emotional balance there are several approaches that can help you recover after a rape or other traumas these might include cognitive processing therapy prolonged exposure therapywritten exposure therapyeye movement desensitization reprocessingwhen youre considering looking for a therapist id strong encourage you to look for someone trained specifically in one of these approaches there are mountains of research studies showing that these therapies have the best success rate when recovering from things like rape a life threatening experience a natural disaster or other traumatic experiences breathe in breathe out you survived and life can get better trauma therapy is usually time limited 34 months and can help you take your life back you can do this
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this the fact that you are concerned shows that you absolutely have emotions about lacking emotions seems like you fear that you are becoming a sociopath and that alone shows you have emotionsit is incredibly normal to feel numb after a trauma like rape the emotional impact of rape can be beyond overwhelming which the brain responds to by basically suppressing those circuits from awareness it doesnt mean your emotions dont existyou brain is just trying to protect you from feeling them because our brains arent great at selectively burying emotions it tends to take them all at once so when new emotionally upsetting events happen the brain sees allowing any emotion through as a threat to the system so to speakspeaking to a counselor could help to process through how you are feeling about lacking emotion if you search in your area or online for a telehealth therapist chances are you will find a therapist that has a background in treating trauma that would suit your specific needs that may mean that they will recommend talking through your trauma which can seem like a very daunting task however the sooner you process through it the less it has the power to take over your lifeits actually really astonishing that you are reaching out for help and i so hope you are able to find what you need
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this i dont need to tell you that this is an incredible amount of serious stuff to happen in a short period when we go through a trauma it is natural for us to shut down as a way to protect ourselves a kind of freeze response think of a possum or a gazelle these animals go so far as to physically freeze in protection our emotions do the same thing sometimes we feel shut down and that can be strangea kind of disconnection this does not mean that you are sociopath or that your feelings will never come back the amazing thing though is that as time moves forward we naturally heal and emotions come back if you feel stuck seeking counseling is a way to help accelerate this healing and help you work through and begin healing wishing you the absolute best
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this im sorry to know this happened to you this is a normal response to traumatic events when we are pushed to the extreme and we are unable to escape we freeze which numbs us from pain but disconnects us from our bodies we oftentimes continue to feel that disconnection until we work through these traumas i would suggest working through your traumas with a therapist with methods like emdr somatic experiencing yoga therapy etc to get your emotions and fullness of life back
i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this i am so sorry this has happened to you i hope you have some people you find emotionally supportive around you in terms of your question i understand what you are talking about sometimes when a person experiences a traumatic event an event called dissociation occurs dissociation is the brains way of temporary creating and increasing emotional distance between what is happening and what you are feeling and experiencing this is a kind of natural coping mechanism and it can occur just prior to during and after an event has occurred people describe the feeling as being numb or detached from others their surroundings and even from their own body all of these descriptions are accurate and they are your brains attempt to try and keep you safe from emotions that may otherwise overwhelm you this is good in the shortterm because you are not having to immediately face and cope with the immensely painful feelings associated with your trauma but it is also notsogood in that it also blocks your ability to feel positive and pleasurable emotions so while your brain is protecting you it is also preventing feelings you need now more than ever such as regaining a sense of safety soothing your hurts and feeling empowered for your survivalyou are not a sociopath so do not worry about that but i would strongly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist or other supportive mental health professional to help you work through what is happened there are ways for you to heal from your experience which will help you get back to a place where you can feel safe enough to feel again it might be an uncomfortable journey at times but you are already hurting and your life is being negatively impacted now good therapy sometimes is like pulling out a splinterit may hurt a bit to dig that sucker out but once its out your body can finally start to heal it might seem better and less painful to leave it alone and ignore avoid it but you risk infection by your inaction which will be 100 x worse than just digging it out best of luck to youlearn more about me and my practice at wwwemdrhealscom

i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true this negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship the fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse good for younightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories including associated beliefs emotions and physical sensations that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed there are likely reminders called triggers of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences this is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you however you likely feel as if you are not in control the goal is protect your current relationship evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings and begin working on healing your memories of abuse in many cases my use of emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories reduce or eliminate triggers bring healing and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship i would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences your decision to pursue counseling and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship with a good support network in place healing is very possible
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship from what you describe about yourself i agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decisionthe nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic naturethe way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partneronce youve stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually maybe all at oncethere is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored abandoned treated harshly during your time of growing up yearssince generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and werent aware of this until going through this terrible relationshipcongratulations on ending your relationship

i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship it sounds like you have not had the opportunity to process through the trauma you have endured it would help if you have the opportunity to speak with someone on a regular basis until the symptoms of your trauma have subsided
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship one thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice that may help to center you tried to stay grounded andor mindful that is being aware of your position in the room your feet on the floor your hands in your lap or your hips in the chair being mindful of the environment you are currently for example noticing what is around you may be helpful try to use all your senses for example you could focus on hearing your husbands voice feeling his hand in yours being wrapped in your favorite blanket seeing a comforting photo using a comforting sense or candle or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchenit also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma i would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professionalremember just because it was the best decision of your life that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again this is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship emdr therapy has shown great results for work with ptsd symptoms which are similar to what you described if you are unable to find a local emdr specialist then i would suggest some meditation and journaling in addition to talk therapy to process your trauma your anxiety response centers int he brain are in hyper vigilance mode and retraining to turn down that response could be helpful for you
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship a lot of times when youre experiencing nightmares and flashbacks it can be a sign that you havent fully processed what happened our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or in an effort to desensitize us to it if you are comfortable with it you may want to consider sharing what youre experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand whats going on also you may want to consider what parts of your past relationship you blame yourself for this can be a difficult task to undertake on your own and the help of the therapist may be necessary to sort through the memories in a safe way typically however flashbacks and nightmares are a sign that the trauma of what you went through needs to be addressed its a great thing that you were able to have the courage to get out of that relationship and you should be proud of yourself for that you may want to begin therapy to address these traumatic memories and help you to sort through any conflicting emotions you have about it ie feeling like its your fault for not recognizing the abuse or getting out of the relationship sooner blaming yourself for being  the kind of person who gets into an abusive relationship  or believing that you somehow caused your ex to abuse you in some way these types of beliefs and feelings can prevent us from moving past traumatic experiences and a trained therapist can certainly help you sort through them
i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship your challenge is called codependency people seek approval from others in an obsessive way when they are failing to truly accept themselves i encourage you to truly love yourself and know that you have every right to every sensation emotion thought and inspiration that you may have best of luck on your journey
my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on was your gf always this way with you or did her withdrawal develop suddenlyalso are there any other changes going on between the two of you in terms of feeling relaxed and at ease with each other enjoying each otherits possible her physical withdrawal due to her sensitive nature about who touches her and the meaning of touch reflects an underlying emotional hesitation about her feelings toward youthis can be either strong positive or negative feelingsshe may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you and withdrawsshe may be actually withdrawing and expresses herself through the amount of touch she wants from othersbest way forward as almost always in a relationship is to have a gentle conversation to open up the tension between the two of you
my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on sounds like she might be triggered and having a trauma response this is normal for folks whove experienced trauma the part of our brains that detects danger acts like a smoke alarm in our house its constantly scanning for threats and makes a bunch of noise if it detects one smoke alarms cant distinguish between smokey bacon cooking or an actual house fire  they just detect a threat and alert everyone of it our brain is similar her brain has probably learned that physical touch is dangerous for her so whatever response she has next is her brains way of trying to protect her particularly with sexual trauma this can be a really frustrating experience for romantic partners trying to connect physically or sexually
my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on thank you for your question i think its wonderful that you are approaching this with openness and curiosity the reaction you are describing is extremely common in survivors of abuse what you said is insightfulwhen you touch her she feels as if she is being abused as a child from your description i would agree that in those moments she is reexperiencing something that happened in the past as if it is happening right now reexperiencing or reliving traumatic experiences is a key symptom of ptsdif you are seeking to better understand what is going on for her i would highly recommend bessel van der kolks book the body keeps the score this book also discusses effective treatments for overcoming trauma best of luck to both of yousarah
my boyfriend is seeking therapy he is in his 40s and has some childhood issues he has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsdont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured a relatively qualified therapist would never make this callpsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenchildhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeif the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting
i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult i have panic attacks nightmares anger and at times depression i feel like im always on the edge or just apathetic can i fix this by myself i am so sorry to here about what you are experiencing your question is kind of difficult to answer because there are a lot of things that go into what caused you to develop ptsd in the first place you could work on developing ways to work on decreasing the negative responses you are having such as panic attacks or anger this could be done using coping skills mindfulness and thought reframing this could help you to not experience the panic attacks or anger in such intensityyou could also perhaps join an outpatient mental health group because they help to teach basic coping skills and provide other helpful resources if you want to go this route look at local behavioral health hospitals or even a local hospital namiorg to find more information about groups or even look on psychologytodaycom to see what you can find near you lastly you could work with a therapist if these dont appeal to you i know this isnt exactly you fixing it by yourself but hear me out therapy is a lot of work but it is also a lot of selfintrospection and selfcare while you go to see someone you also have to do a lot of work on your own a therapist isnt going to make the changes for you they just give you the tools and skills you need to get to where you want to goi hope this helps you and i wish you the best
i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult i have panic attacks nightmares anger and at times depression i feel like im always on the edge or just apathetic can i fix this by myself when it comes to trauma especially in the event that it has caused you to develop ptsd there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks as for your other concerns many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through panic attacks and depression specifically often respond well to selfhelp treatment manuals the centre for clinical interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask

i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better im so sorry to hear about your recent loss there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and its never easy i think its important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else the fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions when it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty the more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours the more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss in talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level writing a poem planting a tree etc or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc we never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us nowbut that also takes time
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better suicide is not a natural way to pass from this earth so many times it can be extremely tough to deal with because of the unnaturalness of the event we may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we couldve have done more or something to stop it but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him you are currently trying to numb your feelings those feelings as nasty as they are are meant to be felt those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation your friend has a legacy remember it and honor that legacy everyday in some small or even grand way perhaps committing or volunteering your time to help others in honor of your friendhope this helps c
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better first of all i am very sorry for your loss and i can understand the urge to drink and smoke to try and cope as im sure you understand alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult confusing and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process it also may be useful for you to add other ways of coping such as taking care of yourself through exercise doing healthy activities that you love and spending time with people that you love self care is often most difficult when we need it the most thank you for reaching out
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better let me begin by offering my condolences for your loss i can understand how difficult this time maybe for you especially if you have several unanswered the questions due to the circumstances surrounding the death of your friend its during this time that you may experience the various stages of grief this includes denial anger bargaining depression and finally acceptance in the bereavement process there is so specific time frame or lengths of time for someone to work through each step its imperative to note that one may express each stage with different levels of intensity also the five stages do not necessarily occur in any specific order we often move between stages before achieving a more peaceful acceptance of death just note that everyone greives differently some internalize their feelings and emotions others express it externally while other avoid it all togethercoping with loss is ultimately a deeply personal and singular experience sometimes we feel that no one understands what we are feeling or going through much less comprehend our emotional state of mind  whats important is that you allow others to comfort you through the various stages my recommendation is to allow yourself to go through the emotions and feel the grief avoiding or resisting may only delay the healing process reaching the acceptance stage of mourning is a gift not not everyone is awarded but seeking the help of a grief counselor may assist in deciphering your emotions and set you on a more positive path to achieve closer
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly everyone deals with their grief in different ways one way i recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them some people like to keep the letters in a jar maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried i recommend writing the letters as often as you need to you will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease i also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area you can find more information on wwwafsporg
i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better i urge you to seek some therapeutic help for this and also to connect with others who knew your friend because theyre likely feeling the same way suicide is difficult to understand and those left behind have many mixed emotions that make their grief complicated and anguished your friend either had an impulse that no one could stop or they made a big decision that impacted everyone around them there are other things you can do to cope with this and it has to do with accepting your powerlessness to stop it not blaming yourself forgiving your friend and finding meaning in their life and yours you wont find that meaning in a bottle or a joint i hope you reach out soon

i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems you are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiencesif you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers the vet center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma heres a link to a directory of vet centershttpwwwvagovdirectoryguidevetcenteraspyour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems the short answer is yes with a maybe tagged on the end let me explain first off thank you for serving our country the vast majority of the population will never understand the sorts of experiences that military members have encountered and we know that veterans suffer from ptsd at higher percentages than civilians we also know that motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of ptsd my friend youve been struggling it seems so it can be helpful to think of ptsd symptoms like a wave or a series of waves sometimes the waves are larger and last for longer and sometimes theyre easier to manage one of the most common ways for ptsd waves to be more challenging is due to something we call avoidance we avoid both internal things thinking about the trauma avoiding unpleasant emotions etc but also external reminders perhaps driving in a car being in crowds being around loud noises people standing behind you etc and the more we push that stuff away the longer those waves stick around therefore trauma therapy usually involves confronting that avoidance in safe and protected ways to try to reteach your brain that even through something might feel upsetting it doesnt mean that youre actually in danger let me give you an example lets say you avoid being in a crowd your ptsd wants to convince you that all crowds are dangerous and between you and me we both know that there are some crowds that are absolutely dangerous if youre in a biker bar where people are smoking meth and throwing knives at dartboardsthats probably a pretty dangerous place to be but maybe you dont hang out in biker bars maybe youre just trying to pick up your milk and eggs at the grocery store when your crowdavoidance kicks in well those two environments are very different could something dangerous happen in the grocery store yes is it likely that youre in danger probably not and so if youve worked through the ptsd from the military but then go through a car accident it might be that some of those old avoidant patterns are popping back up the good news however is that there are several different options through the va vet center or private counseling that can help look for whats called an evidencebased approach these are things like cognitive processing therapy prolonged exposure therapy written exposure therapy or eye movement desensitization reprocessing your counselor can help you decide which might be the best approach for you ptsd is very treatable you dont have to suffer reach out to a qualified therapist
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems it depends on what you mean by problems however a therapist who specializes in ptsd i can say it wouldnt be uncommon to see an increase in ptsd symptoms or severity after something like a car accident it is just adding trauma onto trauma sort of like kicking you when you are down your body may not have the same resources to handle the car accident as it did at other times in your life hopefully that makes sense
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems a car accident can be scary and possibly trigger your symptoms of ptsd it is good that you recognize the possibility of this occurringnot everyone who experiences a car accident develops ptsd the chances are definitely increased due to your prior diagnosis during military servicesome of the things to be mindful of for yourself include1 feelings of anxiety and increased heart rate when youre faced with reminders of the event2 feeling a little more on edge when youre driving3being more watchful youre more likely to scan your environment for potential sources of threats4 avoidance because of the anxiety that often follows an accident its natural that you may want to avoid some situations or experience hesitation at timesif you experience any of these symptoms or feel other symptoms of ptsd it would be advisable to seek help possibly through your local va medical clinic or a private practitioner there are certain modalities such as emdr that can help with your symptoms
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems there are many types of traumas and they certainly can compound on one another as you experience them without treating the traumas or incidents where you felt there was a significant risk to your safety or that of others there can be a cumulative effect what we have learned in the mental health field from studying traumas is that the body as a whole responds to these stressors in order to keep you safe during the events if the body does not realize that it no longer needs to respond in this way because the event is now over and then receives a trigger from a new event it makes sense that the new event could cause additional issues both of these events can be addressed with the help of a counselor there are many counselors that specialize in trauma inside and outside of the va so shop around if you are able and find someone that you connect with
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems a car accident can be a traumatic event especially if it was serious you could have feared for your life felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards this may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military if it is then it is possible that you will see a direct effect in triggering off ptsd symptoms even if it didnt it is possible that the complexity of the two situations will interact inside you to be a combined response having already been diagnosed with ptsd this might be a good time to reconnect with the help system you had around military experiences and explore it a little bit about the new experience the right exploration does not have to make things worse and can be a good source of prevention
i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems post traumatic stress disorder can occur after any traumatic event where a real and present threat of harm or loss of life to yourself or others is present yes a car accident could increase ptsd symptoms such as hypervigilance anxiety nightmares replaying the event etc depending on the severity of the accident new triggers might exist this is not to say that you cannot recover are you currently experiencing additional trauma symptoms
my mother has quite severe undiagnosed ocd diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder and maybe other mental health issues she is weeks away from moving in with me my husband and our three children i love my mother but once she gets within her own area she begins to tape all cracks and crevasses she cannot tolerate any smells one way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevassesas long as her behavior isnt aggressive harmful to anyone unethical or immoral and youd like her to live with you then someone both sides need to be happy with the living conditionalso if you havent already done so negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks as part of adjusting to living with your family it is reasonable to expect she respect common areas and to limit her taping habit to her private sections within the houseapproach the matter fairly and with the expectation to satisfy all the people who are affected
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painfuleveryone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by livingall of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of othersthe best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationshipsif you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of originthis realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situationsthis type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parentsexpect slow progress and expect more than a few tearsif it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourselfsending lots of good luck
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater hi new york theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future because its a huge part of who we are the good news is though that the effect doesnt have to be negative im met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently every day what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in and it helps them make really great decisions you can accept your past integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way if you see negative ways in which your past affects you and this is also common you are wise to seek professional help without knowing more its impossible to give you a lot of direction here basically our past creates emotional bruises that are touch on and triggered by present situations but our reactions are often about more than just the present moment i think you know thati wish you the best as you sort it out
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater i can imagine how incredibly difficult this must be for you having past traumatic experiences creap up on you without warning can be very scary and stressful you may be suffering from symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder getting evaluated by a professional would be a good step to take next by seeking treatment and having a therapist who you trust and can connect with you will gain the ability to think about your experiences without it significantly interfering with your daily functioning a therapist can also help you to develop new coping stragies to be used during recall of these experiences and help you to adopt healthy thought patterns i would also recommend that you seek support from loved ones sometimes just talking about your experiences and associated feelings will alleviate some of the emotional troubles you are suffering from lastly you may find meditation or mindfulness work to be of great benefit having the ability to live in the present moment should reduce the effects of your traumatic experiences interfering with recalling your past or looking forward to your future i wish you all the best
i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater in general our past is always somewhat alive and does inform our present experiences all past experiences both positive and negative are what have brought you where you are today physically and emotionally that being said your fathers behavior does not have to define you or your future you have power over your life and your future by learning more about yourself you can learn to incorporate your past into your present life without being defined by past traumas the best way to grow and learn how to do this is to talk with someone about your experiences by talking about your past and present struggles with a trusted confidante or helping professional you will hopefully learn how to be at peace with your past
as you already know there is no easy answer over time i think we learn to live with the pain from such a loss but it never goes away i would encourage you to seek out a grief support group or a therapist who specializes in grief and lossi will just add that one thing that you can do is to create something meaningful from this profound experience this might mean connecting with others who are mourning or creating beautiful in your childs memory of course the best ideas will come from you

i was a victim of an incident ive been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because i dont feel anyone honestly believes me there are so many other factors i deal with on a daily basis i ignore my problems when im with my friends but its scary when im alone im glad you have some time when youre not thinking about your trauma when youre with your friendsas far as feeling scared when you are alone im not sure if you are referring to having flashbacks or thoughts on what happened to you or reminders in the environment around you or something elseone thing that might help is to find a bead or a rock that is smooth that you can hold onto or rub against your hand or fingers think of a time when you felt safe comfortable happy  basically a positive and safe moment  while holding onto the rock then when you have scary thoughts you can hold on to the rock and remember the happier place try to associate as many happy and safe moments with the rock as you can
i know i was molested as a child but i have no memory of it im not sure that i have the answer to your question but i can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist there are a list of them here httpwwwnatboardcomindex_filespage548htm you also may want to talk to someone who specializes in emdr this stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment i am not trained in this particular method but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started
check with your local nonprofit agencies i am sure there are programs which provides services for others in the same financial position as you many have sliding scale fees based on your income which can be 0
this can be tough to do in this moneydriven crazy world where many therapists are not taking cases probono anymore and quite often charge exorbitant prices for sessions however i would ask potential therapists if they do take any cases on probono i usually reserve some hours for people who simply have no finances but need help there are still some that do if your exmilitary you can look at give and hour which is an hour a week for exservice members often times you can look to your local pastor minister or priest there are still some good ones out there to help with finding or providing help to you there are free hotlines you can call that are staffed by knowledgeable people that cost nothing lastly you may look into getting state insurance which would enable someone to take you onhope this helps c
depending on where you are located you may want to consider calling 211 it is a resource hotline that can help provide you with referrals for therapists or clinics in your area who may offer probono services when going through the list of referrals they provide you with you can call around and see what types of treatment they offer for ptsd and make a list so you can do your own research before deciding what you think will be the best fit for you there are several different types of trauma therapy but some of the most common include cognitive processing therapy and emdr in case youd like to research them and get more information
you may have some options for lowcost or free counseling1 there may be free counseling services available in you area you could try an internet search for free counseling  the name of your community in addition in many communities your can dial 211 for access to information about many free services2 if you are a military veteran you maybe eligible for free counseling through the va the vet center or the soldiers project you can get more information herehttpwwwmentalhealthvagovvamentalhealthgroupasphttpwwwvetcentervagovhttpswwwthesoldiersprojectorg

im fine when we start becoming intimate but out of nowhere i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me sexual intimacy can be very triggering for survivors even when it is both wanted and consensual you may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma to work through the abuse if you have not already done so often times triggers still hold such a powerful effect when the emotions related to the abuse have not been fully processed in the meantime you may want to consider coming up with a safe word to let your partner know that you are being triggered or to communicate your physical boundaries to him often times the experience of communicating your physical boundaries to your partner having those boundaries respected and validated and having a partner who is understanding and willing to engage in intimacy in such a way that does not violate your physical boundaries can reinforce a sense of safety with him

as a child my parents injured my brother so they went to prison i was there when he had gotten hurt but i cant seem to remember i also cant remember being with them quite well its a blur sorry to hear of having witnessed violence within your family when you were very youngyour blocked memories are a selfprotection from the enormous emotional pain and feeling destabilized by realizing that the people whom you expected to trust are harmfulalready you are at the first step which is to know that memories exist about the disturbing events concerning your brotherprobably the best way of finding your way back to those times is by paying attention to all of who you are todaythe more intently and with loving interest you are able to notice yourself you will be gradually dissolving the layers of protective thoughts about intimacy being unsafebasically you will be teaching yourself how to slowly trust yourselfsince trust is what was violated while you were young you will be developing a new model for trusting yourself and othersthen more of the memories of your painful and overwhelming times will make themselves available to youthey are simply waiting for you to be strong and trusting enough within yourself to tolerate them
my supposetobe father told me to go find my real dad we havent been getting along since i was a teenager if i said one thing that he thought was wrong i always got degraded he never said i love you he never gave us hugs hes always called me horrible names i feel hes an evil man with no feelings hi louisiana you got it righthes supposed to be your father its tough enough being adopted unless im reading it wrong i think youre adopted what you dont need is to be verbally abused by someone whos supposed to love and protect you i dont know how old you are past teen years though or where your mom is but i bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently its your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly thats a really important part of learning how to be happycarefully choosing whos going to be in your life its tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposedtobe father but its possiblephysical distance avoid him if you dont trust youll be treated with respect and emotional distance feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability i think youre already doing that part because you dont blame yourself for his words which is wonderful i dont know if hes evil although i believe evil exists but he may be incapable of loving properly or lacking empathy as you suggest a good therapist can support you in these goals i wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult 
an organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies the study was to implant a fantasy other people are having but to me its a nightmare i lost my kids my job and all that i was an unwilling participant i no longer trust a therapist im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable there is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause i understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves a therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again if therapy feels too unsafe at the moment i would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques acceptance and commitment therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy you may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstacle
i did some horrible sexual things as a kid and i regret everything can someone help me cope with myself can someone help me remember my past im very sorry to hear this hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories however keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone i think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial it seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward in addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise i wish you the best of luck and i hope you receive the treatment that you deserve

im a teenager and throughout my entire life ive never really had good parents or parents at all for that matter im not exaggerating i was living with my mom and grandparents until my father in prison for most of my life got out when i was in middle school his mom my grandma only lived a mile down the road from my moms house and i was so awestricken with my dad that i got to stay with him for a long time meanwhile i did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs my mom went to prison for that and lost her café we live in a very small town so everyone knew about it and i was bullied because of who my parents were my dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison
my mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that persons house my parents did not get along at this point we were driving him home one day from this house and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out he got out of the car went to the drivers side and punched my mom in the face i got out and told him not to hit my mom at that point i was really scared and mad that he did that so i ran towards him to stop him he literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road i couldnt even walk my mom tried to help me but he started choking her i hobbled over and she barely got into the car and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance he was so badly strung out on drugs he went to prison again and seems to be doing well i met up with him once with my grandma and we had coffee but hes so hard to handle i think a lot of it is that i cant bring myself to forgive him my mom went back to prison again for drugs and while she was in there i moved in with my dads mom the one who lived just down the road because i trust her her house is stable and shes more nurturing understanding and loving then my other grandparents i also stay at my boyfriends a lot now that my mom is out of prison shes trying to control every aspect of my life shes trying to make me move back home out of susans house and i dont want to i dont like it there they condone drug abuse and many other things and im just not comfortable shes even threatened to call the police and say im a runaway because she has custody of me my boyfriend has always had this pictureperfect life and his family are strict christians one time his mom even went as far as to say that if he and i break up if we were having sex i would say that he raped me ive got so many problems i dont even know what to do thank you for reaching out and i can see that this is getting to the point that it is becoming overwhelming with all that is going on to address your question the best answer is that it will take time and from what i read you are still living through it  so your feelings are perfectly normal for the situation i get the impression that you really need someone to process through all that you have been through and unfortunately getting adequate feedback would best be done meeting one on one with a therapist vs through a question answer forum if you are currently in school you could see about meeting with a school therapist or if you are over the age of 15 in most states you can consent to your own therapy if you choose not to meet with a therapist i would encourage you to call a crisis hotline to help you safety plan to keep yourself safe around your parents 18002738255 if you chose to meet with a therapist keep in mind that a lot of what you experienced can be reported to family protective services since you are a minor you can also choose to make a report if you are feeling unsafe with your parents im glad to hear that you have your grandmother for support im sure this is a lot to take in and i wish you the best
he is verbally abusive when he gets mad he just yells at me at times i feel scared im sorry you are experiencing this and im glad that you are looking for help and support im not sure of all the details so take from answer what you can if you are feeling unsafe or scared in your relationship please know that there are non profit domestic violence services that can help and provide you some more support they can also safely plan with you if you choose to leave it seems that you might be feeling defeated and if thats the case a lot of domestic violence non profits provide free counseling if you are needing to talk to someone what you are going through can be overwhelming and your are taking the right steps toward healing
he is verbally abusive when he gets mad he just yells at me at times i feel scared good for you on recognizing your own feelings often in an abusive relationship the person who is being abused starts doubting themselves and starts tolerating then accepting abusemarriage is based in love and feeling taken care of by the partner feeling scared is the opposite of thisif you feel ready tell him the way you feel and pay attention to how willing your husband is to being aware that he yells and that you feel scaredif he has no idea of what youre talking about doesnt want to understand what you feel then slowly take steps to understand within yourself whether or not tolerating your husbands behavior is acceptable to live with on an everyday basis
my kids dad and i broke up two years ago he still wants me back and i just started to fall for him again but our kids are with child protective services thats why we broke up he started to talk to other women and he put his hands on me what you are experiencing is common with survivors of abusive relationships even abusive relationships have positive moments in them and typically for survivors those are things they still love and care about of the abuser a lot of it could also be grief over the loss of the relationship and also your children a lot of time people return to thier abuser because thats the only support that they have if this is something you are going through i would encourage you to seek out a domestic violence non profit in your area because they can provide you with additional support i dont know the whole situation but keep in mind that abusers will make promises and say what they think the other person wants to hear to get them to return attached is an example of what i am talking about httpwwwbfwcorgpdfcycle20of20violencepdfbased on what you decide i would encourage you to keep caution and boundaries it might be helpful to safety plan with a domestic violence non profit

i am a survivor of domestic violence from a past relationship even after seven years i still have horrible nightmares i wake up in sweat and the dreams feel so real nightmare are actually very common for survivors of domestic violence if they are affecting you the the point where you feel like you need to do something you may want to consider processing your memories of the events with a trained trauma therapist another good option may be to attend a support group for survivors where you could process your memories in a safe space where others will be able to provide support and understanding for what you went through as well as encouragement for the strength it took you to get out of that relationship you may also want to consider completing a screening or assessment to rule out posttraumatic stress disorder as well
i am a survivor of domestic violence from a past relationship even after seven years i still have horrible nightmares i wake up in sweat and the dreams feel so real hello and thank you for your question first things first i am so glad that you are alive and very sorry that you had to endure such a terrible experience now lets talk about these nightmares the first thing i want to tell you is that you are not losing your mind many people start to think that may be the case if they are still suffering from the affects of something that happened a long time ago thats not the case there is no time set time for which we should be over something like this i am not sure if you received counseling after what happened to you but that may be something to consider bad nightmares could be the sign of something like post traumatic stress disorder ptsd which would include other symptoms like being startled easily reexperiencing the event or avoiding places that remind you of it there are other symptoms as well so if you believe this may be something you have you may want to seek counseling there are good treatments for ptsd if you cannot seek counseling at this time there are some things you can do to try to manage the dreams on your own i would encourage you to look up sleepy hygiene and try to make your bedtime rituals as relaxing as possible you can also google search nightmare rescripting or nightmare exposure and get some ideas on how you may be able to change your dreams it may be a good idea to attend a domestic violence support group and get ideas from other survivors who no doubt have had sleep problems related to their experiences too hope this was helpful be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
after a domestic abuse situation i went to a therapist and then my husband went the therapist discussed her assessment of borderline personality disorder with me she then told my abuser the results of my tests it sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission there are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however for example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that personif you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality you can always contact your states counseling regulatiory board the board will then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action
my husband and i have been together for seven years now i will be honest i have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff i recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because i was afraid to tell him what happened ever since then he gives me the cold shoulder he gets so mad and ignores me for days hes really verbally and emotionally abusive he tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names should we call it quits im tired of crying but we have a toddler together hi texas thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask should we call it quits we i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together the way your husband treats you is not your fault texas your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you the problem is not your lying the problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trusttheres an analogy that i sometimes use i dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but its powerful either way so i will tell it to youif you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die if you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying it has lost its strength its called learned helplessness when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you you have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child in my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse this is a complex picture and if you were my client i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child i sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist i wish you the best
my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now throughout the entire first day that we met he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another that same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed the next two days were a repetition of the first day on the third night my mother finally caught us and i was kicked out of my house i left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple it was very hard for us his stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month after that it was a downward spiral we were constantly arguing about money food and our families we kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument after six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started one afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one he told me to let him leave or he would hit me he had once promised he would never touch me so i challenged him to do it he slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me i havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now i dont live with him i dont depend on him and we dont have children we both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly he always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i dont ever make the effort to try to be okay ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me i know he has to change that on his own i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned is there hope for a better future together hi winters i learned a long time ago that i cant ever predict who will change and who wont i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change only you can decide how many years to give it i see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though what are you waiting foralthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change it doesnt work that way just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work you can only decide when youve paid too much i bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you hes not your only support
i have anger issues that have worsened over the years because ive never dealt with my emotions my anger has never been expressed physically until the past year my girlfriend has had to endure these episodes i love her and i think im about to lose her if i already havent i throw things at her when im angry and sometimes i hit her i may not hit her enough to cause harm but i still physically lash out at her i dont want to lose her and i dont want the situation to worsen i am a lesbian in my early 30s and i have been dealing with anger since my childhood im ready to change i need help now im about to explode hi baton rougeim glad youre reaching out the first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours i do hear you minimizing your actions you say you dont hit her enough to cause harm but youre headed in the right direction i hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm youre causing isnt just superficial bruising the effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds please seek treatment for yourself immediatelyyou say you love your girlfriend do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partneryou have dangerous habits because you dont know how to manage your own emotional pain you can unlearn this and it doesnt mean youre a bad person sometimes however the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended for both of your sakes because too much damage has been donei know you dont want to lose her but you dont own her and you dont have the right to trap her in this because youre afraid of being alone right now she needs some space to figure out whats best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants this is potentially the first step to learning real respect honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort i wish you well
i have anger issues that have worsened over the years because ive never dealt with my emotions my anger has never been expressed physically until the past year my girlfriend has had to endure these episodes i love her and i think im about to lose her if i already havent i throw things at her when im angry and sometimes i hit her i may not hit her enough to cause harm but i still physically lash out at her i dont want to lose her and i dont want the situation to worsen i am a lesbian in my early 30s and i have been dealing with anger since my childhood im ready to change i need help now im about to explode good for you for recognizing that a change has to be made quickly regardless of whether or not your girlfriend leaves your relationship taking control of your anger needs to happen sooner than later if left unresolved it will follow you into any relationship you have have you talked to a therapist i would suggest you take that step first a therapist will help you explore the source of your anger and teach you new adaptive ways of dealing with your anger until youre able to get some professional help i would advise that you start recognizing when your emotions are becoming escalated and take a time out before the anger turns into aggression if you feel yourself becoming heated excuse yourself from the situation go to a quiet place or on a walk and practice some deep breathing clear your mind of the problem and focus only on your breathing as you inhale slowly counting to four and exhale slowly counting to six dont get discouraged if it doesnt work right away deep breathing takes practice return to the situation or your girlfriend only once you have calmed down and are confident that you are not going to hurt anyone you might also want to ask your girlfriend to remind you to take a break when she recognizes that your emotions are escalating know that with help and support especially from a therapist the issues you have can be resolved and new ways of coping can be learned good luck
ive been with my boyfriend over 3 years he cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant he is physically and mentally abusive towards me i have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues however he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything im always there when he needs my help he tells me although i help him doesnt mean that i am a good person he always discredits me as a woman and its hurtful i spend most day crying and feeling lonely i am unhappy and unsure of what i need to do that sounds like a very hurtful situation unfortunately without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop i do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship as an abuser his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means i recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area i have worked closely with harbor house of central florida and know they provide housing transportation and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship there is help out there and you are not alone if you need any additional resources in your area please dont hesitate to contact me
i have a child with my baby mother she works i take care of our young son she says she is not cheating i have not found anything but she always putting me down telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me but then the next day after our fight she says she does im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops now me and my family dont talk shes always telling me im annoying and just belittles me nothing i do is right she says i work you watch the baby on her days off she never cooks or cleans i have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy but says hes not any thing to her what do i do i dont want to leave it sounds like you are in a tough situation you have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her is it because of the child or is it because you want the relationship to work you must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child so if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move outon the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging it seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship although your question revealed just a short bit of information i didnt read about any positives in the relationship sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you however with time and focus you can do it each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your childhowever if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her you need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you this gives her a chance to render the situation if after this there is no improvement i suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stayi also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy are there any hobbies you enjoy are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefitit is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family you need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment latelythank you for reaching out i wish you the best of luck with your relationship
ive known my boyfriend for several years we were friends for a long time in 2013 we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state i planned to move in with him in 2014 after i finished school and he found a job however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time we decided later to make it work shortly after i found out that i was pregnant i wanted to tell him during his next visit however he never came to see me and instead asked me for money after i gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts soon after i experienced a miscarriage i texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care i was extremely hurt by this i still decided to move back as i had originally planned he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him during this time i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know although he says he did i hardly ever see him he never got a job which was in the original plan after that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together once we got back together i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in i thought he had too but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman in fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her when i confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car i dont know what to do there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life i think youll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect
now i have anger and trust issues how can i treat this and fix myself i will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this however i highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas that would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issuethe important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you angry yes at your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you having trouble trusting of course the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries where you end and i begin
when i got home my boyfriend and i got into an argument he got upset and he started hitting his face that is the first time he has ever done that but i would be lying if i said that didnt scare me i locked myself in the room sounds scary to watch i agree with youmaybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotionsnow that the incident is past bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss itjust the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time may be restorative to himat the very least you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place
when i got home my boyfriend and i got into an argument he got upset and he started hitting his face that is the first time he has ever done that but i would be lying if i said that didnt scare me i locked myself in the room seeing your boyfriend hitting his face sounds very scary sometimes when people are experiencing strong emotions the emotional pain becomes so overwhelming that they try to relieve the emotional pain by causing themselves physical pain it is a dysfunctional way of calming themselves down i dont know your boyfriend or your boyfriends history so i cant know for sure if that was what was happening but i am certainly glad that he does not do that on a regular basis when you are both feeling calm and if you feel comfortable talk to him about what happened it is difficult to be in a relationship when you are scared and dont understand why the other person engaged in a frightening behavior if you feel safe enough and do not worry about his reaction i would talk to him about your feelings regarding what happened if you dont feel safe enough and are worried about his reaction or that he might hurt you talk to someone who knows you or a therapist who you could feel comfortable confiding in so that they could guide you on how to move forward

sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious i even start throwing things do i have a problem you easily get angered because you havent trained your mind to ration how your brain interprets the events you experience as a result you act after an event happens because you do not ration and question to find out if your interpretations of events are rational and legitimateanger is an emotion that communicates to us that something is not right and we feel threatened and have to fight back in self defense all it takes is one event to be trigged and the rest is history anger management can help you identify what triggers you so that you can train yourself to be able to interpret events in a rational wayanger is not the problem it is what we do when we get angry that is the problem
sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious i even start throwing things do i have a problem its important to think to yourself about what it is about losing the comb that gets you so angry what are the thoughts that go through your mind when things that are out of your control like losing the comb happen its okay to be upset but some selfawareness about whats going on to cause those feelings is important and only you can know what thoughts are going through your mind when you find yourself becoming angry is it that you feel badly about yourself when these small things happen if thats the case then you need to work on your selfesteem is it that you are frightened when you dont know where something is and that causes the anger try to identify the thought behind the feeling as for the throwing things when you become angry please know its okay to feel angry feeling the emotion of anger isnt necessarily a problem any emotion is okay to have its how we express our emotions that sometimes becomes the problem throwing things can be a dysfunctional way of handling anger like if the things you throw break or if someone sees you throwing things and becomes scared and it would be a good idea to work with a therapist or anger management coach to brainstorm some healthier ways to express your feelings
sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious i even start throwing things do i have a problem anger does have its place when anger is experienced often or the magnitude of it does not fit the scenario such as your losing comb the question becomes what does losing that comb mean to you in the very split second that you have realized the comb is missing there is a reaction that occurs within you accompanied by an image or thought that like lightening flashes so quickly that you may not be aware what it is as sherry noted below awareness awareness is fundamental becoming aware of ourselves and what is happening internal that sparks it off the next time you feel angry from a small thing stop and ask yourself why am i angry that this is lost find out what you are thinking or how you are speaking to yourself you will become aware and once you are aware steps can be taken to alter the experience for the better a professional can assist with that

sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious i even start throwing things do i have a problem anyone who asks whether or not they have a problem usually feels at least partly that they do have a problemyour answer to the question is what matterssince you already understand that your reaction is overstated to the events which trigger them the reactions youre having are more than likely anger that is leftover from past events either in the near or distant pastbe aware consider reflect on how you usually handle feeling angry based on your description here it is quite likely that the anger you show toward what you call little things reflect anger at much bigger matters that are uncomfortable and not easy to understandknowing more about the more significant matters causing frustration for you may very likely decrease reacting angrily toward smaller matters
when i think of things people put me through in the past i get upset all over again and take it out on everyone ill be mad for nothing at all and have a attitude with everyone for no reason it sounds like you have had difficulty in processing what happened to you in the past and because of that difficulty in moving past what happened to you when you are reminded of what happened you get angry all over again please know that it is possible to remember what happened but to also not have the same emotional response it is very common to have difficulty processing a traumatic situation that occurred in the past many people go through this a good therapy designed to assist with this type of issue is emdr try to find a therapist who is trained in emdr to help you with processing these memories so that you dont have the same emotional response every time you think about what happened best of luck to you
when i think of things people put me through in the past i get upset all over again and take it out on everyone ill be mad for nothing at all and have a attitude with everyone for no reason youre definitely not mad at nothingi agree with your point about not emitting your upset about internal matters onto people who have nothing to do with what bothers youyour internal stressors are real otherwise you wouldnt feel the way you describetake time to understand what bothers you about past situations and leave open the amount of time you will need to feel finished with examining these topicsthe more thoroughly you understand yourself the less likely you will be to bring past stressors into current relationships
i get really mad easily at my parents and family anger is usually pain and frustration which cannot be expressed directly to people in your surroundingshow someone can be less angry is by directly saying your thoughts and feelingsone approach is to to tell either or both parent that you would like them to hear youknowing you tried to be heard adds to your own selfrespect regardless of their willingness to do as you askif you are simply left with no chance to make yourself understood by them then look for ways to expand your social support system so you do have people who willingly hear and talk with youeven if social media groups are the only format available to you it is at least some type of human interaction and interest in who you are
i get really mad easily at my parents and family anger is not necessarily a bad thing if you are angry and you can talk about your feelings that would be very helpful anger usually comes along with something else like feeling sad worried overwhelmed confused and many others consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point if you get along well with friends and dont get angry with them look at the differences do you feel criticized by your parents or family misunderstood there could be any number of thingsi wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry anger is a real emotion in itself it almost always connects to something else as well

i get angry and act out it scares my wife and child anger is a normal emotion no different than joy elation or sadness its not anger that gets us in trouble its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they dont readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they dont take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior in addition i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that youre angry remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion ie disappointment hurt frustration etc hope this helps
i get angry and act out it scares my wife and child well yes of course it scares them they see someone they love behaving is frightening ways thats a good reason to want to manage your emotions differentlybut what are your thoughts on your anger do you think your angry feelings justify lashing out the thing is that feeling angry is just thatfeeling acting out is behavior and that affects everyone around you do you need to manage your behavior as well as your feelings my guess is that you dofirst you need to pay better attention to your feelings thermostat if you are always near boiling you dont have much margin for error its in your best interest and that of your family to bring that temperature down that may mean more physical activity meditation journaling or some other outletthe next and bigger question is what are you so mad about or are you really sad scared confused anger is a secondary emotion much like pneumonia is a secondary infection anger which sets us up to defend ourselves against a perceived danger is often a cover for feelings that leave us more vulnerable that means people who are grieving may exhibit rage people who are scared may lash outthat doesnt excuse bad behavior but it might explain it get in t o see a therapist asap you need a bit of help to identify both anger triggers and underlying feelings that get played out as anger you are not a bad person for exhibiting emotions but anger can quickly become destructive  get help now
i get angry and act out it scares my wife and child yes you can if you cannot control your temper who can you have more power of your emotions thoughts and feeling than you are giving yourself credit for if this is scaring your wife and child you need to get control of it immediately try going to an anger management class it will help to discover what is the root cause of your anger what triggers it and how you can controlmanage it if you cant go to a class try self help books or even better yet counseling and support of a professional counselor
were in an eight year relationship my boyfriend drinks a lot he experienced childhood trauma i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts you shouldnt need to educate yourself on violent outbursts he is the one in the position to change his violent outbursts they are his behavior not yours all youre trying to do is have a relationship with this guythe one task to do is during a quiet time to tell your boyfriend the way you feel about his outburstshis answer whether he denies having a problem blames you for his problem tells you the problem isnt so bad why are you complaining tells you a lot about his willingness to changewhether or not he considers himself to have a problem and wants to change himself is very good for you to knowthis tells you what to expect from him in future you can reflect and plan ahead for your own life depending on your tolerance and willingness to live with what he answers you
were in an eight year relationship my boyfriend drinks a lot he experienced childhood trauma i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts first let me extend my compassion to both of you  it sounds like you have a lot on your plates childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us your question is brief so ill just try to give general answers as best i can from my experiences treating many people with your boyfriends experiences the short healthy answer is that you cant fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help he needs a professional period what you can do is take care of yourself with his background it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way your task needs to prioritize your own safety and wellbeing trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries manage his own emotions and behaviors so your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the nearterm certainly not without professional help you might also benefit from help and support to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life i am not blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriends behavior only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship if you have accepted your boyfriends drinking and violent outbursts in the past by staying in the relationship that is likely to perpetuate his behavior and there isnt any way to handle violent outbursts they shouldnt be handled at all and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe then that may be what you will have to do we can never really change anyone else the only person we can change is ourselves sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another persons behaviors but it doesnt control it i would recommend that you work with a professional to first ensure your own safety above all then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to and which you want to separate from whatever your boyfriend does in his life you will be happier if you manage your own feelings set boundaries etc let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery
any time things get heated the past gets brought up i raise my voice at her to try to get a point across she asks openended questions but always has to turn my own answer against me shes seven months pregnant i have drank in the past but im not dependent on alcoholi only drink at social events have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of yousince your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them the more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible momentsif you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control then try scheduling a discussion about them this by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about
everything just makes me upset anger often comes with a lot of other emotions consider what else you may be feeling at the same time and keep track of your different mood changes you may be able to notice patterns such as being more frustrated when you dont sleep well if you do feel as though you are mad all the time can you think of any exceptions so you can see what is different in those times
my longterm girlfriend broke up with me recently she says its because of my anger i need help controlling my angeranger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues anger also helps us understand that theres something wrong that needs to change once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry then we can explore the source of anger ask yourself why am angry am i hurt disappointed confused embarrassed etc once you find the answer explore how often that happens and whats your reaction then explore how else you could respond or react you could use istatements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario this is a good exercise to practice with your counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration especially if you have been angry for a long timealso it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression and learn to manage our anger before we act on it anger is a feeling aggression is when you act out your anger physically verbally and psychologically find ways to vent crying or sweating will help to release your anger and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotionsnecesito ayuda para controlar mi corajeel coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos el coraje también nos ayudo a entender que hay algo mal que debemos cambiar cuando entendemos que algo mas causo el coraje entonces podemos explorar la fuentepregúntate a ti mismo por qué tengo coraje estoy herido decepcionado confundido avergonzado etc ya que encuentres la respuesta explora cuan frecuente tienes esa reacción luego explora como puedes reaccionar en otra ocasión puedes usar expresiones del yo para comunicar tus verdaderos sentimientos a la persona envuelta en la situación esto es un buen ejercicio para practicar con tu consejero o profesional de la salud mental ya que otros conflictos sin resolver pueden surgir durante este proceso de exploracióntambién es importante entender la diferencia entre el coraje y la agresión y aprender a manejar el coraje antes que actuemos el coraje es un sentimiento y la agresión es cuando expresas tu coraje agrediendo a alguien física emocional o sicológicamente encuentra maneras de desagotare llorar o sudar te pueden ayudar en este proceso al balancear la respuesta química que crea el cuerpo cuando estamos molestos el la actividad física y la meditación también pueden ayudarte a relajarte y tomar un descanso cuando manejas emociones fuertes
