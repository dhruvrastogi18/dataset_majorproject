all of these needs in your present relationship before he becomes your husband you should examine these areas and see if they are high in rating otherwise yes this relationship will affect your girls and you negatively i would suggest relationship counseling specifically premarital not be surprised if through the process you realize that this relationship is not the best choice for you and your children
i been having anger problems a lot lately it only takes one word wrongly said to set me off i use to not be like this until i got with my soontobe husband i think his mood and rageanger problems have rubbed off on me a lot i dont get nearly as bad as he does but i yell almost constantly and i cant seem to just stop i have two young babies that have to hear this and i dont want my girls growing up with a mommy like i have been lately i just dont know how to get back to my old self my gut says that your own rage is being triggered partly because you feel trapped or shutdown by your fiances moodyangryrage responses and powerless to stop it you can start by accepting that this is who he is and you wont change him you can only change your own behaviours and i see you taking responsibility for those which is great you want to protect your girls and thats appropriate children are greatly affected by this type of home environment i urge you to see a therapist so you can understand your own emotions and sort out the choices you have to make knowing that your fiance has to make his own choices about his behaviours
i have not been able to really sleep i stay up all times of the night not even knowing why every day i feel like i have anger inside of me i have a little family but i cant open up to them like i want to i have a son and i feel that i take my anger out on him by screaming at him best question iswhat are you so angry about you cant stop being so angry until you figure out what is the root of your anger if you feel like you have anger inside while i am sure you do taking it out on your son is only passing on the hurt and anger this will be inside him too get some professional help so that you can be happy and have a happy child
my issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself my rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor it causes violent thoughts but i never act i stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent not me i dont want to drown myself in anger and resentment knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel are fine qualitiesanger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into wordstry thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such timesalso if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations even without drinking the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memoryif this describes part of your childhood then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express
whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting i say mean things to let my anger out whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful i hurt the ones i love with my words i want to be better for myself and them congratulations on making your way to step one selfobservation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to othersthere is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possiblestart on the inside track of your own heart and mind once youre able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people youd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind they arefor example if you expect others to always be accepting tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend and youre hearing otherwise from people then you can prepare yourself for possible less than positive comments about your relationship or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at allbasically the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views the easier and calmer time youll have in handling comments from others that youre not glad hearingalso this is a long process because youd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interactingbe patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process youre placing yourself
whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting i say mean things to let my anger out whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful i hurt the ones i love with my words i want to be better for myself and them taking accountability for your actions and seeking help is an excellent first step i wonder where the anger is coming from learning what is at
the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some
relief in itself i would also suggest doing some selfexploration and see a
therapist for individual sessions in order to gain a clearer insight as to what
the cause is there are also several actions you can take on your own to help
control your anger and communicate more effectively here is what i would recommend
you try
take time outs when you feel yourself becoming upset excuse yourself and
take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of
action or redirect your thoughts all together often when we become
angry it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotions get in
the way
do deep breathing exercises close your eyes breathe in slowly to the
count of 4 breathe out even slower to the count of 6 practice this for about
5 minutes 3 times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this
time once it becomes routine for you it will be easier to apply during
situations in which you are angry or upset
change negative thought patterns try and recall or be aware of your
thoughts particularly when you are feeling angry what are these thoughts
telling you are they valid or logical is there factual evidence to support
the negative thoughts often the answer is no learn to stop the
negative thoughts and replace them with logical and more positive
ones
communicate effectively as a speaker you want to use i
statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming himher
by using you statements for example you might say something such
as i feel sad when you dont come home at a decent hour and i dont get
to spend time with you versus you always stay out late and dont
even care about me the speaker should also avoid using black and white
language such as always never etc as the listener you want to validate what
you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening you will also want
to be responsive and offer fair solutions
i wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes
from
whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting i say mean things to let my anger out whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful i hurt the ones i love with my words i want to be better for myself and them hi californiaim happy to hear you want to get a hold of this problem relationships dont tend to last when we treat people poorly it is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort i would highly suggest working with a therapist and i will give you a few things to think about in the interimsometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair but many times anger is a secondary emotion and its simply there to protect us from other more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important perhaps you feel powerless or unloved or unimportant it may take some time before you recognise this emotion once you do you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion where did it originate at what age did you feel too much of that feelingso much so that you cant stand it even in tiny amountsyou will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling they are typically incorrect thoughts like no one lifes me or people will always hurt me fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that arent likelyyour habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of selfworth and you dont believe people will love youso you hurt them to keep them at a distance this happens in a subconscious level do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you didnt believe in your worth so its backwards really because you think youre getting mad at people who piss you off but youre really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourselfin addition to this work you can start to purposely treat people more kindly find out what respect is make amends and resolve to spreading peace it might sound too simple but if you act as though youre a person of peace you will start to feel more peacefulbut i hope you do contact a therapist it will take time and support to reach your goal
i dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger thats really the only one i feel well then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you havewhat is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feelsometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they werein some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind by knowing where your difficulties started you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelingsalso spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are often people who have difficulty in expressing themselves suffered shame and humiliation as a child they have a chronic sense of worthlessness and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression by having a good time being with yourself you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating
the sounds of eating and breathing gives me headachesmostly mouth breathing and snoring it makes me angry and i want to solve it myself probably good to know in what type of situations you are in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoringif youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchenbasically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling themdepending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds or not willing to change or not has a good deal to do with next stepsi dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the headone path i dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered or dismissing your own sensitivity someoneyour needs matter
i need answers to my anger possessiveness and urges
i am angry all the time i push people away so much that i actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was i have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine i have these urges to hurt someone really bad i want to see them beg for me to stop hurting i want to hear their agonizing painedfilled voices what is wrong with me what result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describemaybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions with how you would wish to feel from relating to otherssince you ask what is wrong with me there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in returnthis is true even with imagining doing harm to otherswhat are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting othersbesides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors what gain which is not evil do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being
i have a really bad temper i get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day i dont mean to be that way but i cant help it a lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves a surface situation like a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by tuesday and when that particular tuesday comes the store doesnt have what they told you they would and you are furiousthe fury may have more with many times before in your life having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever itif at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life the relationship didnt allow for honest expression of all your emotions youd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearlywithout practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone eventually the person possibly you learned to contain and contain your emotionsit is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately are muting hurt feelings that youve understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history to not talk aboutas a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear are really the underlying source of your upseti hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions
i am so angry i feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress and i dont know what to do i want to sit down with a psychologist but i cannot afford one nor do i have my own health insurance i can feel myself starting to get violent i throw things of value when i start to get mad i have punched holes in my wall i can feel my aggression getting worse first off it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made it is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with lifes obstacles including anger management there are several strategies that you can try to help control your anger but the ones that i would recomend first are the following1 try a different way of communicating with your parents since arguing with them is a great source of anger for you learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit choose a time to talk with them about heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened use i phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on them validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view2 when you feel yourself becoming angry take a break simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhale even slower counting to 6 focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes3 stop any negative thoughts in their tracks often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly when you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational if you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts4 finally find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angryi wish you all the best
i am so angry i feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress and i dont know what to do i want to sit down with a psychologist but i cannot afford one nor do i have my own health insurance i can feel myself starting to get violent i throw things of value when i start to get mad i have punched holes in my wall i can feel my aggression getting worse im sorry you have so many arguments with your parents ideally parents are people who tolerate that their kids are people with their own unique characteristicseveryone likes feeling loved by their parent do you feel loved even though you and them have clashesanger is a symptom of a problemthe real question is knowing what feels like its being hurt inside of youi agree with your idea of talking with a psychologist or some other type of licensed professional therapistsee if your area has a family service agency in it generally the nonprofit sectors offer sliding scale fees and if you qualify your cost per session would be financially comfortable for youone possibility is to tell your parents that youd like starting therapy because of feeling so much stress from the family arguingthey may very well be surprised to learn of your maturity in assessing your level of stress and be willing to make a positive contribution to this by offering to authorize therapy through their health insurance they may even decide on family counseling so all of you work together to relate in more loving wayslast if you arent ready to speak with your parents about wanting counseling think about speaking to your school guidance counselor this person may have some recommendations for your specific geographic location
i dont know whats with me im almost constantly angry even when im happy i still feel anger inside me when i acknowledge it it ruins my mood and takes over i get angry at the littlest things even if i think someone said something they didnt it infuriates me something perfectly normal can make me go off when my anger flares up i get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while its like there is a fire constantly burning in my body and anger is gasoline hi nashville im glad you want this to be different it doesnt feel good to be angry all the time and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships im sureworking with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that so when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something youd rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is in that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face or the shoe that someone left in front of the doorits that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on firei suggest finding a therapist to work with you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them 
anger is a natural and healthy emotion however it can be difficult to deal with if it becomes overwhelming and depending on what we have been taught about it and how to express it a competent therapist may be able to help you figure out ways to relate to your anger and your mother that will feel right to you
when i see something i dont like i go off like a ticking time bomb i go from 0 to 100 really quickly sometimes we react to situations immediately without thinking of the consequences of our actions typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly one of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing when faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6 while focusing and thinking only about your breathing after doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate good luck
every time i speak he says i anger him also when hes mad at something like work he gets angry at me i feel like were so distant from each other now we used to laugh all the time and i feel like he lets too much negativity in what should i do weve been married for two years but together for seven hi newark it sounds to me like your husband is going through something and i think you understand that you might feel very helpless sad and disrespected at the same time hes changed its unfair for him to blame you for his emotions his mood issues are about him not you and hes either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries you can let him know when you feel disrespected and whats not okay with youhe may be experiencing depression which often shows up as irritability in men it could be that hes not telling you something or hes unaware of his emotional processes you can try a im really worried about you you dont seem happy and i dont know how to help you some things are happening that arent okay with me will you see a therapist approach perhaps you could go with him the first time its about a combination of compassion selfrespect and seeking professional help i believe i wish you well
im a teenager i get random spurts of anger like complete pure rage i figured it was hormones but others notice it too i get selfdestructive i used to cut but stopped now when i get mad i bite my arms and fingers pull my hair scratch my face or punch my thighs basically i do things i can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom i dont live in a bad household i have a great family a great relationship with my boyfriend and a good job i have no idea what this is and i dont know how to control it its over any little thing tonight it was because i couldnt get my earrings out this happens maybe two to three times on a good week and its always over stupid petty things hi im glad you wrote in general when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectivelywe just want to avoid it as quickly as possible cognitive behavioural therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively you say that your behaviours are self destructive and i agree it sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem this is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you again a good therapist can help you learn whats behind your shame and selfharm your feelings are normal and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help
first id like to say that i cant imagine what it must feel like to live in your shoes and have to be exposed to such treatment oftentimes people dont recognize how serious this type of abuse can be its very important you first recognize that it is absolutely impossible for any of us to change a person so the only thing you have control over is you  your response your set boundaries and your support system its very important that you set healthy boundaries express these expectations to him and consistently follow them i cannot stress how important have a strong support system  a circle of caring people  who can help keep you accountable with your boundaries and who you can reach out to if you ever feel your safety is at risk there is only so much i can explain via writing so let me know if you need any additional help feel free to contact me  natalie
i easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger i suggest that you work on emotional awareness emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and whyemotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you dooften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsbeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodmany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways if a man never learns to say i am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodyou can control yourself and not explode walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you what is the real feeling driving these outbursts maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern it might help to keep an anger journal write down everything that gets you upset that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience
i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month one of the ways to decrease nightmares is to document your dreams in addition to keeping a dream journal its important to work with the content of the dream and revise the endingits important for you to work with a therapist that is trained in dream work the researcher montangero 2009 pointed out that in using the cognitive approach to dream analysis the therapist follows the basic tenets of cognitive behavioral therapy and that they help the individual to enhance their cognitive skills in order to be able to alleviate their psychological distress for example in the treatment of nightmares one of the methods that is used with the cognitive approach is imagery rehearsal therapy the basic premise of the approach is that those who have recurring nightmares and are experiencing insomnia later come to understand that the insomnia is brought on by anxiety unlike cognitive experiential dream theory the approach does not integrate other theoretical orientations the approach to nightmares and the treatment of them is aligned with cognitive experiential dream approaches as the individual has the opportunity to revise their dream if they have an unpleasant dream although the scary dreams may not disappear altogether they may lessen in frequency
i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month theres a narrative approach that we call nightmare rescripting that may be helpfulsince we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening we try to alter them while we are in a waking state in a nutshell this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have typically there is an element of fear danger or helplessnesssecond we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment control competence andor safety in other words if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted we might change the events of the story so that you call the police get to a place of safety or even fight back and protect yourselfthird you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again so that it becomes a well rehearsed story the effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping this new more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream best of luck
i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your waking lifedreams and nightmares are the nonlogical ways in which we make emotional sense of what goes on in our everyday waking worldbesides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct controlyour nightmares may offer useful clues as to what youre trying to resolve in your life pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking lifeif you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare or taken advantage of or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare then look for where in waking life you may feel similarin this way youll become clearer about stressors in your life that you may not have realized existed were it not for the stress of nightmares
i get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two it usually happens in bed at night but i occasionally experience this during the day i have a benign brain tumor but the doctor said it is not associated with this im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening i know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature as far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on these are just some thoughts but i think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start
im a teenage girl and my dad is an alcoholic i hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out he can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons and half of the time i dont even know if hes sober or not i refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes ive either been barely sleeping or i over sleep so im always tired i live in a small town so theres no one i can really talk to because im not really that close with my family hello and thank you for your question you are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help good for you i
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too
""
first good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions  such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated it is really important that you consider your safety above all
else
to answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other peoples actions there are various
reasons why we do this for one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault and depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it what is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around
as for the other things you mentioned i am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing it sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school
you may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on i will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily if you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report
if you dont know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to they may have some ideas
sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things you may be able
to find something like that in your state i do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful
this is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that i encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy try really hard not to let that happen if
you have interests do them if you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well exercise can really help when
we get stressed
i hope some of this was helpful good luck

sometimes 3 times a night perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems i find that change states while sometimes difficult are very exciting they give you opportunity to grow more rapidly so i say congratulations mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg
sometimes 3 times a night dreams are our chance to make sense of our waking livesif youve got a lot going on in your life then your dreams are your assistants in understanding these happenings and dynamics
sometimes 3 times a night as a depth therapist aka psychodynamic practitioner i do a lot of dream work with clients and they gain great insights from our explorationswe remember dreams i believe because dreams are messages always in code from the unconscious communicating the crux of unresolved conflict between who we are and who we think we are supposed to be you might be remembering so many dreams because your conscious mind is ready to hear these messagesand make some internal changes in responsewrite them down youll be glad you did a broad crosssection of these these messages will help your therapist help you interpret the meanings of these communications from you to you and possibly chart your best path forward toward to resolve the cause of psychological symptoms you might be experiencing
sometimes 3 times a night thats a difficult question to answer dreaming is a normal and healthy part of the sleep cycle the current thought is that we all generally
experience roughly the same number of dreams  the difference often is just
whether we remember the dreams or notan increase in the number or frequency of distressing dreams
or nightmares can be a symptom of stress anxiety or ptsd if the dreams are disturbing to you talking to a local
counselor could help if the dreams themselves
are not troubling you may just be remembering them more than most people do

my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex one question i have is how would this impact your relationship now if you were to know the answer it sounds as though you may be experiencing issues with trust in your relationship i believe the bigger issue here is not whether or he has had sex with someone else a few years ago but more that you lack trust within your relationship are there other behaviors youve noticed that indicate untrustworthiness it may be worth exploring sources of mistrust versus dwelling on a possible affair hope this helps

my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex it sounds like youve been living with this uncertainty for those couple years since this happened the reality is you wont ever know  mostly because of the various versions your husband has provided you infidelity though painful does not have to kill a marriage secrecy and dishonesty certainly will though i encourage you and your husband to seek therapy together with someone who specializes in couples work the longer you wait to do so the more damage is done to whatever connection you have and the greater the distrust will become please get qualified help for your and your husbands sake
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex the fact that he has several versions of the story could indicate the presence of deception concerning the events that occurredif he expressed that he may have had contact with a prostitute there may be a likelihood he may have had sex but you cannot be 100 percent certain the suspicion alone would appear to be a source of distress for you having the std screening will certainly be helpful in terms of your health since it appears that he may have been involved in an indiscretion that may also be interpreted as a breach of trust between you
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex i am so sorry you are going through this the harsh reality is that you cant possibly know being in a healthy relationship means that you have to trust that what your spouse tells you is true if he tells you he was not with a prostitute and you dont believe him than that means there is lack of trust in your relationship if you are experiencing mistrust in your relationship and are worried about infidelity or stds that is very serious and it sounds like you both could benefit from being in marital counseling together trust is so important in any relationship and if the trust isnt there its important to build that trust so you can have a happy and healthy home together if your spouse is unwilling to go for marital counseling with you then go for individual counseling there have been plenty of success stories when even just one of the spouses goes for therapy
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex most of us trust our guts or go to someone who can help us to piece the puzzle together like a therapist in this case is that whats important the knowing that he had it or knowing he had it and how he allowed himself to get into a situation like that if he did how do you feel about it im curious it sounds like you are too talk to someone to explore this situation hope that helps
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex the short answer is you may never know the only person that really knows is him here are some things to consider if youre asking this question it may be an indicator of the health of the relationship itself it wouldnt be a waste of your time to try some relationship counseling i dont know where you are in your mind on the relationship but couples counseling is not only for couples on the brink of separation yes it can help avoid separation but it can also help work out issues exactly like you are asking about even a healthy relationship can be taken to the next level with some relational therapy every now and then
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex that is great that he shared this information with you that you were tested and hopefully everything was okay and that he continues to answer your questions about the event it sounds like you are still having some trouble with what happened and that is okay and normalnatural the question i want you to focus on is why you want to know if he had sex with a prostitute i want you to think about what this information would do for you how you would use it whatif anything would change in your relationship because of this information i also want to ask yourself if you feel like you trust your husband has he done anything like this in the past or since he shared this information with you i dont have an answer for you and you may never know because it sounds like he might not even know he did share this information with you he did make sure to care for you and make sure you were tested for stds and he does continue to try to answer your questions im sure he feels a lot of shame and guilt about this experience and understand that you are still feeling hurt and confused by his actions i think it is important to explore the event how you are both feeling about it and even discuss ways to feel safe when he travels again if that is something that is causing stress and anxiety
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex unfortunately you will never know the true answer this is really frustrating to hear but you will never 100 be able to guarantee that he has given you the truth so if you can work on accepting that breathing through thathe may not fully remember he may have lied to you in the past or he is lying now he may have been honest then or he may be honest not as for options you can talk to him and provide a safe space for him to tell you what happened this could be a private conversation with you or at a counseling session he would need to feel safe to tell you the truth but remember there are no guarantees you would need to make a decision to trust him or not and go from there a couples counselor can help guide that conversation and make sure that he is feeling safe to share more important than if he actually had sex or not i would evaluate your relationship do you trust him now were there trust issues before does he hide things now identifying your current trust levels will be important for having a healthy relationship now hope this helps even if it is frustrating to not have guarantees
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex hello the truth is that you will never know unless your husband decides to be upfront about the details to gain your trust one thing is for sure though not knowing and having this uncertainty in your heart will push your husband and you further away from being able to repair the marriage the best thing you both can do is seek professional help to navigate this issue and start doing damage control it sounds as if you are committed to this marriage and i am sure your husband is too it will take some time and purpose but you can recover from this if you both commit dont wait and start working the steps to find peace of mind and a way to reconnect with the man you love mirellaimage and likeness counseling
my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex the only two people who know the answer to your question are your husband and the prostitutethe question you did and can answer is the reason you would doubt your husband which is bc of his multiple storiesideally your husband cares to restore your sense of confidence in the stories he tells youif you state your doubts and your interest for the truth ideally he will produce enough evidence of the truth so you will have facts and can make sense of them hopefully the two of you will do this sense making together especially if he did have sex w the prostitituteif hes unwilling to care about restoring your trust in him then this is a different problem entirely
my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way because the acrobatics and excitement of sex has nothing to do with the meaning of deeper emotional attachment to another person with whom we are in a relationshiptry to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband
my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way hello there as you have courageously explained your soulful dilemma i can appreciate the complexity of this situation you have identified some key factors that may be contributing to your sense of feeling empty one is the ultimate goal here able to be acquired from this arrangement are you trying to have your fulfillment with another woman while in the presence of your husband but not with him on her as much or at all are you trying to ask him to be more passive participant perhaps be careful of not drinking too heavily in the whole event how do you want to feel intimate or connected  were you craving all along him to really be all over you along with her these are questions that arise maybe not solutions its always good to be very clear with oneself of what is the ultimate target here and always measure the potential danger peace  keith
my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way as someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory i can tell you that your experience is incredibly common it can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels that being said it also lowers our ability to make well thoughtout decisions this combined with the brain rewarding novelty new lover new experience with our partner etc and maybe even some overzealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you my encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage now if you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening i would definitely push the issue and see whats up from his perspectivethe empty feeling could be any number of things includingfear that youre not enough for himfear that shes better than you in some wayfear that if we keep doing this thing he will need it and what happens if i no longer want itopposite fear of what if i now want her more than him or if i want the threesomes and he doesntfear of does this mean our sex life isnt good enough as it isdo we have to always add a little spice to keep it hotor like robin alluded to preconceived notions about what culture religion family and friends etc say about what marriage and sex should look like i also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in therejealousy insecurity shame regret longing when you can identify and name them they are easier handled some of the resources i recommend poly sexually open couples arelove in abundance a counselors advice on open relationships by kathy labriolathe jealousy workbook exercises and insights for managing open relationships by kathy labriolarewriting the rules an integrative guide to love sex and relationships by meg barkermore than two a practical guide to ethical polyamory by franklin veaux  eve rickertthe game changer a memoir of disruptive love by franklin veauxthe ethical slut a practical guide to polyamory open relationships and other adventures by dossie easton  janet hardyopening up a guide to creating and sustaining open relationships by tristan taorminoopen all the way confessions from my open marriage by sadie smythehenry and june from a journal of love  the unexpurgated diary of anais nin 19311932personally i find your cravings to be healthy and quite normal the key is to make them work well for you and your partners robins also right about communication being key some of the suggested resources above can help get those conversations started and if you need further assistance absolutely i would find a sexpositive polypositive counselor to chat withbest of luck to youtamara powell lmhc
my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way hello and thank you for your question nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new many people who engage in open polyamorous andor othertype relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes this doesnt prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one and many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception there could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do one reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages they are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesnt mean that you havent been influenced by them we all have another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening perhaps there are a lot of what ifs going on in your mind when you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling one thing that i do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband it may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if you will it is important that you are both on the same page about what this is and why you are doing it if you continue to struggle i suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality i wish you wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way you need to have an honest conversation with each other about why you both want a threesome evaluate the status of your relationship with each other are you having issues fighting not feeling satisfied with each other how has your sex life been with each other if there are any problems insecurities issues introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well sure there are some who successfully live this lifestyle but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other harbor no jealousies or insecurities and arent looking to someone else to satisfy needs that arent getting met by their spouse let me say that again this is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure jealous or looking to have needs met by this other person that you arent getting from your spouse that empty feeling youre having  listen to it dig deep to find out where it is coming from what thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way youll get the answerthe other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other if you dont like it that he paid more attention to the other girl he needs to know that and he needs to respect that if youre going to do it again he needs to know what youre comfortable with and what you want set the limits before youre in the moment before its too late to take an action back turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a womanit is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment a lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship people who marry young andor inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them but dont want to hurt their spouse the reason you are both doing this matters a lot if there are problems in your relationship this is likely to only make things worse
my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this a while back 3 years ago i asked him to stop drinking so much and he agreed i caught him one night drinking behind my back i confronted him and he lied but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again lately my husband has been drinking on and off but i noticed it was every single night i didnt like this for our new years resolution we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption he was on boardno more drinking every night
the other night i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing it took a couple of days but tonight i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing but i couldnt wait i asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and i cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking he slurred a bit and said no i asked if he had been drinking but he snapped and said no i went into our room to sleep leaving him on the couch im not sure if im overreacting or not i just feel like im so honest with him about everything and i expect the same honesty he is a good husband in every other regard hi los angelesso your husband is giving you mixed messages he says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it his behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent it sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partner your husbands lying is sending a message i get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it underneath that maybe its i want to stop but im ashamed that i cant and i dont want you to see my failures ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout pushbackbacklash how does his drinking affect you thats where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out asking if hes been drinking seems confusing youve mentioned snoring which i guess is a legitimate complaint if hes passing out thats a legitimate complaint when he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you all of these things are legitimate concerns and id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers my guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress so he checks out with alcohol and it also helps him avoid your relationship but the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you then more you chase him with your questionstheres a conversation that would be helpful here it sounds like ive tried to support you in your drinking less and its not working what are your goals for alcohol and how can i support you in that more effectively id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking but focusing on the things that affect you what concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement can we get the alcohol out of the house is he willing to seek treatment lay your expectations out really clearly i wont count your beers but i cant tolerate lying you have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers or is it something else what do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage what does he need does he let you know what isnt okay with him he might have trouble saying these things the drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage a qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart understanding it and changing the way you relate to each other

im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 wait what normal teenage experiences a pedophile is someone that is attracted to children meaning under your age category this is regarding mostly adults that are over age of 18 you are only one year apart try and focus on friendship and work on keeping yourself busy in activities so that you are not having these type of thoughts direct this energy into a more productive activity like sports reading biking exercising or something other than negative thought patterns dont attract what isnt supposed to be part of your life good luck
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 you are not a pedophile you are both under 18 and your age is appropriate for a relationship there would be a possible problem if she was 10 or younger pedophelia is a whole other problem that you probably should not be worried about i would be happy to talk with you in more detail about this
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 it is very natural for you to be attracted to someone that you find an interest in building a romantic relationship with these feelings are an emotional response toward adulthood you are at a healthy age to start the development of attraction and intimate bonds with those around you pedophilia is a disorder in which adults or older adolescents find themselves continuously sexually attracted to children and minors at the age of 15 you are still considered a childminor yourself that is growing into his own adulthood this is healthy for you to seek the elements of attraction and intimacy there may be a lot of confusion during this time due to the effects of puberty and all the changes you may be experiencing during your adolescence phase in this case see if you are able to reach out to your parents caregivers andor trusted adults to seek an understanding of those elements to help with any confusion with age attraction and underage dating
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 a pedophile by definition is anyone who is sexually attracted to children this is applicable to children to are prepubescent so im repeating others here but you are not a pedophilethe fact that you worry about this means that you wouldnt be ok with being a pedophile sounds like you have a healthy reaction to your girlfriend
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 the short answer is no it is not wrong for you to be attracted to your girlfriend you are a perfectly healthy person when puberty hits hormones start changing and it is a natural to be interested and attracted to others it may feel wrong especially if you are a christian and have grown up in that home due to the messages that are sometimes sent your way but as a christian myself and a counselor i remind people that every human is made with a very similar biological makeup if humans did not have an innate attraction to others then the human race would not survive because we would not marry or have children you are not a pedophile
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 nope in fact you are not a pedophile that term is reserved for older adolescents attracted to children or adults who are attracted to children i see an age difference as being one key factor in determining pedophilia if the older person is still in adolescence you being only a year older than your girlfriend doesnt qualify so go right ahead and be attracted to your girlfriend without shame
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 you wrote that each of you is under the age of 18 a 15 year old cannot be a pedophile because youre not an adultalso if you mean girlfriend in a romantic way then this makes sense bc romantic relationships include physical attraction to the other person
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 no you are not a pedophile you are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so your both only a year a part so this shouldnt a worry to you like frank said below pedophelia is a problem that wont apply to this situation
im 15 and my girlfriend is 14 am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under 18 no thats perfectly normal youre under 18 too youre only a year older than she is this is absolutely normal what would be wrong is if you did anything to her against her will always remember that no means no respect her respect yourself and be a normal teenager have a healthy relationship holding hands kissing and more should only be done when both are comfortable with it and agree to it although it is frowned upon by a lot of people its no secret that teenagers do have sex even if their parents and perhaps religion would definitely not want them to do it only you can make the choice that is right for you just be responsible in the choices you make some states have laws on what age is old enough for consensual sex youd be surprised how young those ages are a 14 year old having sex with a 20 year old would be against the law but someone the same age as her or just one year older is not wrong can be defined in a lot of different ways though is it against the law no is it against your religion i cant answer that for you you can however have a relationship that is not physical in any way its okay to just be with her and enjoy her company you can hang out watch movies together go on dates do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing your relationship can be anything you want it to be
i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago why this is happening and what can i do about it i want to be short and brief about this first if you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend your penis is fine however erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis if you are having any sort of mental related concern anxiety depression stress etc it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect after reading your concerns my questions would be what are you thinking about right before and during sex do you feel anxious or nervous during that time have you ever experienced not getting an erection before i am assuming it has do to with what you are thinking and their is a certain amount of anxiety you are having during or right before sex if you want to work this out i would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body meditationrelaxation exercises focus more on enjoying the experience through your 5 senses what do you smell take it in and enjoy it what do you hear take it in and enjoy it what do you see take it in and enjoy it what do you feel take it in and enjoy it calm yourself not having an erection is not the end of the world and happens all the time to men if you freak out about it it will happen more just relax believe it is normal and try again and enjoy the beauty in front of you
i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago why this is happening and what can i do about it sexual desire seems to be straightforward  i like someone and i become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them  but that idea does not always take into account other factors stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs when we are overstressed for example we often find ourselves ill at the same time can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress additionally focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection while this may seem counter intuitive it makes sense in the word of stressfinally its never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor as well you did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body as well
i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago why this is happening and what can i do about it first off i want to acknowledge the emotional pain you must be experiencing about not being able to experience an erection  youre not alone and it took a lot of courage for you to post your query here below you will find excellent advice from skilled clinicians regarding your question and concern if you havent done so already id encourage you to checkout the mayo clinics website on this very topic httpwwwmayoclinicorgdiseasesconditionsseasonalaffectivedisorderbasicsdefinitioncon20021047once youve ruled out any medicalorganic issues with either your pcp or urologist i recommend you work with a certified sex addiction therapist csat andor certified sex therapist cst and do some psychotherapy around attachmentfamilyoforigin intimacy selfimage trauma history sex history pornography etc  there is hope
i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago why this is happening and what can i do about it this is something i have
had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practices focuses the answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session if you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives subjective intersubjective objective and
interobjective  also known as the four quadrants in determining where the
challenges are it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situationin this case from the upperright
or behavioral and physical perspective we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked such as blood pressure we would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornography next we would look at the
upper left quadrant thoughts cognitions identity feelings to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times if you are worried about your job your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate this can
contribute to your situation from there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant cultural rules and tools to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift update andor reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges it would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your familyculture of origin views the profession finally we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant systems laws
rules of society such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you needto sum your question then
of why you cant keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after look at
your behaviors look at your physical body for issues look at where you picked
up your rules and tools culture and look at your ability to access goods and
services they all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account so  as you can see there is no one possible answer to this but several i hope this helps
i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago why this is happening and what can i do about it this issue could come from any variables the pressure of being satisfying or if you have experienced anytension do you have any uncomfortable thoughts or is anything from your past coming up had you been socialized to believe certain things or did new beliefs come up what were your models of healthy relationships was anything of substance coming up around the time this began some have found acupuncture to be helpful or even the emotional freedom technique eft
i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago why this is happening and what can i do about it im sorry to hear of your problemfirst step as always when a possible medical explanation exists go for a urology check up to either your internist or a urologistonce you know there is no medical reason which would prevent an erection then we can consider the psychological and emotion based factorsmaybe youre nervous about your sexual performance or that your gf may be disappointed in your performancemen often mistake their own fears of performance failure with the assumption that their partner thinks about sex as a performancetalk with your gf about whatever is on your mind which may inhibit you from enjoying sexthe reasons are endlesswhat matters is to have a heartfelt dialogue with each otherthe emotional support which comes through such an intimate conversation may very well be the catalyst for a more relaxed and satisfying approach to sex w your gf
for some reason i feel very uncomfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body in certain poses on social media i know she is proud of her body and i respect that but i dont feel comfortable with her openly showing off her body the way she does
anytime i bring it up to her she thinks im calling her a whore how can i deal with my girlfriend showing off her body on social media and not hurt her feelings ask her to consider your feelings not only her own defensiveness that she is called a whore by youclearly since youre writing on a site which offers psychological and emotional support and guidance you do not consider your gf to be a whoreshe may not realize or considered that you are somewhat protective of who sees her body in the end she may not want the privacy over her body which you are encouraging her to haveat least you will have the satisfaction to know you stated your actual reasons for your request and did not rely on the ones she imagined you have

my fiancé and i have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me i recently found out he cheated on me with another women he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on infidelity is common in a largest study conducted to date about 1015 of women and 2025 of men admitted to being unfaithful while in a monogamous relationship you are not alone and you can get through this just like countless couples have done before you first of all you need to know that although there may be reasons for his behaviour eg not feeling sexually satisfied those are not excuses he could have chosen to masturbate instead of cheating on you right your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you then there is hope the question is  are you willing to put in all this extra work forgiveness is not easy and it may take a lot of time and effort for you to consciously choose to trust again it wont just happen if you dont work on it and yes its unfair that you are being asked to work on this when he is the one who had been unfaithful even though it is hard you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on you cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the longrun all of this is hard work is he and this relationship worth it are you equally committed to making it work if so dont abandon this relationship just yet work on it together ideally get a few sessions with an experienced couple counsellor and see where that gets you for additional specific ideas check out my tips for how to deal with infidelity in a relationship good luck

my fiancé and i have been together for 3 years and our relationship has always been good the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me i recently found out he cheated on me with another women he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on i think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work but theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed you say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core would you agree with that or what are your thoughts were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives if you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs for instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested this is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations in essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually this leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called the five love languages its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallythis is a long post im sorry but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it so back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back you cant just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him get that bookin conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past i truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there if you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again

my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive i love him so much why do i do this there could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away it could be part of how you were raised it could be because of culture it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you pushing him away what is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect so what if you arent a hugger a kisser or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship there are many ways to show affection that arent physical words of affirmation giving of time andor gifts etc if your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching
my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive i love him so much why do i do this there seems to be two issues at play your sex drive and the resulting pushing your boyfriend away research mirror work sometimes this technique allows us to get to the root of our issues you can also practice this in a therapeutic setting if that feels like your next right step having control you get to be in control and decide what happens next which could be at play on a subconscious level also investigate your feelings around intimacy and what does that truly means for you and this relationship overall
my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive i love him so much why do i do this are you sure it is only the birth control pills which has changed your sex drivemy guess would be that possibly due to the hormonal changes of the pill your own awareness and understanding of yourself in this relationship is what is actually changingbirth control pills control ovulation they dont directly prevent people from all desire to express affectionallow yourself some time to reflect on how you feel toward your bf it is possible the birth control pills triggered a change in your attitude toward himand maybe independent of the pill maybe you just are done with the relationship
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do keep doing the crossdressing since you like ityour problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about itnot keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about usonce you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing based on their handling of this intimate part of your life you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to themsecrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time the person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship felt good or at least not worrisome
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do while this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone it is important for you to be yourself its better to weed out 10 people who cant accept you to find that one who can
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do thanks for asking this question i think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy for that reason i would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happyas far as telling girls or keeping it a secret i dont really think that its necessarily one or the other at least not the first time that you meet in other words one part of your decisionmaking could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date or perhaps something that you address after youve known each other for a couple of meetings the answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating i would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this it sounds like this is an important part of you so i would think that if you were going to date someone longterm you would want them to know about the most important parts of you including thati also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdressid also ask you to consider this are the people who you say this to expecting it my guess is that the answer is probably not along with that are they going to have questions i would imagine soare you comfortable answering questionsi wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questionswhat exactly is crossdressingdoes that change the gender that youre attracted towhat does it mean to youwhy is it important to youand what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressingthere could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationshipi certainly hope that you find the right person for you i imagine that having this conversation could be stressful especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do normalizing crossdressing and being open about who you are consider if this could be a dealbreaker  which would encompass considering if you want to be with someone who does not accept you for all you are also explain your personal reasons and the possible reasons many others crossdress how it is not always for sexual stimulation
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do if you enjoy crossdressing and it is an integral part of who you are giving it up for anyone else or to get into a relationship will only lead to resentment and resentment in a relationship usually leads to its demise so i would caution you against giving it up for someone else as you wont be happy and neither will your partner because they will be losing out on getting to know your authentic self stay true to your authentic self and balance that out with dating people who do the same and are open to exploring thoughts and feelings in a relationship you definitely get to choose the right time to share this with a partner and i encourage you if it feels safe to talk about it as soon as you can sometimes just keeping something a secret for a long time in a relationship can also lead to other issues too also if you know the other person doesnt respect this part of you if you find out early you wont waste your time and can move onto a relationship that feels more supportivei hope this makes sense and i wish you the best of luck
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do it would be my professional opinion that the desire for you to keep it a secret at all while yes i could see it as giving you a chance with a girl is something that might be more about a discomfort for you if you are comfortable with your kinks and fetishes if i may call it such not my intention to pathologize in any way though then be as open as you want to be but i also dont know that you need to be announcing it as part of your online dating profile because you do say it bothers girls i ask out which to me implies that that is what youre leading with my hope is that people dont make dating decisions based on your kinky behaviors but more likely that they would make decisions based on your own comfort and security with said kinky behaviors
i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do your happiness and healthiness is key i would not suggest that you hold back and keep it a secret you should be upfront about it but perhaps gently bring it up on a date when thinking about whether or not you should stop think about how it makes you feel perhaps try to be social at more accepting affirming locations in your area the people who will accept you for who you are are out there you may not be looking in all of the places you have available to you
im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this have you said anything to your husband about the way youre feelingstart with thissex is after all a two person enterpriseif he would like to talk about the way youre feeling great and wonderful the two of you already are continuing to grow trust in your communication and relationshipif he doesnt want to talk about how youre feeling then youre facing a different problemyour feelings are real and need to be handledif you end up facing your feelings of frustration about your husband not wanting to have sex with you on your own then does your husband give you a truthful sounding reason as to why notask what explains his disinterest in having sex with youif he doesnt want to address this question then you are a little further down the rung of trust and care about youdepending on how satisfied you are with his answers will guide you on how much dissatisfaction you can live with and why longterm
im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband i want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you and regardless of outcomes i hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage if your husband was to work with me id explore with him his understanding of and experience with intimacy in relationship with others furthermore like other male clients of mine id challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his pcp primary care physician andor urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy if there are no physical issues per se i would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin storyline regarding rules roles sex and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories
im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this this could have many different origins have you tried asking him about it sometimes starting with asking whether he would be open to having an important discussion can be a good beginning if that starts well perhaps continuing with something like ive noticed that we havent been together intimately or whatever phrasing works for you as much lately can you tell me more about what its like for youwhen asking questions like this it usually helpful to not overuse and perhaps try to avoid using the word why that word tends to trigger really strong emotional reactions in people try starting with what makes instead for example what made you choose not to do that

i have been married for 11 years within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected your question highlights your pain very clearly what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward my mind immediately goes to a question for you what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for what do you say to yourself about you about your spouse and about your relationship what do you do in response to these feelings do you ask for what you need does this lead to arguments do you stay silent or withdrawvery often couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other and is often seen as critical and nagging regardless of who started it these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship if both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together as the patterns slow down partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities needs and longings and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesnt leave the other partner feeling criticized threatened abandoned or uncared forsome couples can do this without the help of a therapist the book hold me tight 7 conversations for a lifetime of love by sue johnson is a selfhelp book based on emotionally focused therapy the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists and has been helpful to many couples that i see when a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals i recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy such as emotionally focused therapy you can learn more about eft or find an eft therapist here httpwwwiceeftcomto summarizeyour pain is understandable and valid its telling you what you are missing and what you wantreconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us express those feelings in a safe way and assert our wantsneeds while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partnerif you can do that on your own and your relationship is responsive thats fantastic if you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated pain means this is important you and your marriage are worth the effort

i have been married for 11 years within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected im sorry for how youre feeling in your marriage lately are you and your husband able to talk directly about your feelings the way two people connect is usually by talking with each other to understand what each one cares about and thinksyour current emotional suffering is the natural result of being married to someone who shows no interest in doing thisif your husband wants to start talking with you then there is a chance the two of you can reconnect if he doesnt want to participate in the relationship with you then start to think if its possible and for how long to get emotional support from friends and family who do care for youalso a question for the future is to understand what the value of your marriage is to you besides having a connection to your husband
i have been married for 11 years within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected im sure youve tried to talk to your husband but if not could you have a conversation with him about him and his life his work etc see if he relaxes and opens up to you even a little bit dont try to have a heavy conversation or even unburden yourself to him during this first conversation  just try to be lighthearted and focus on hearing him its the first step towards getting your needs met too and ending any emotional standoff that might have come about between you
i have been married for 11 years within the past 2 years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected what you are describing is something i often refer to as living with your roommate phenomenon this is the idea that you feel like you are living with a roommate and no your partner or spouse  it is not uncommon for members of a couple to report to feel both physical andor emotional distance when we dont feel connected within relationships this can be isolating and lonely the emotional distance often makes us wonder am i important to the other these types of feelings need to be better understood in the context of your own background and upbringing ie who you are and also better understood in the context of your couple feeling reconnected can occur but there is not a one size fits all solutoon as a first step do you or your partner have any ideas of how to feel reconnected have you considering talking to your partner about the emotional void or how about discussing solutions  together that might help from individual therapy to couple therapy to a weekly date night to inquiring about one anothers personal interest to starting off the conversation of what both of you want and can do to reestablish feelings of connectiveness if this is too frightening ie to address the lack of connection between you and your spouse a fist meeting with a couple therapist can likely help unpack what the possible solutions for your couple

my dad cheated on my mom for 13 years i cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when i know he isnt i have full access to his phone social media and emails i never find anything but im obsessed with constantly checking just in case how do i stop this its driving a wedge between us hi greenville i respect that youre owning your own overreactions and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves the truth is that some people cheat and some dont and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trustedthe answer here is in two different areas basically if you want to feel differently more trusting in your case you look at your thoughts and your behavioursyour thoughts are stuck like tires in deep ruts in the road these thoughts are only habits they dont reflect the truth fear is probably whispering in your ear things like everyone cheats or  youre not enough for him once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you picture those words in red next time they come up ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there wont be muchperhaps none and what is the evidence that doesnt support it i know lots of good men i know i deserve love and loyalty there is no sign of infidelity youre learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear thats the first half practise these thoughtsthe rest of the work is in your behaviours act as though you trust him force yourself to not check or interrogate and the less you check the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel acting as if something if true strangely helps us believe itits possible to change the way we think and this is turn changes the way we feel try this to start and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it good luck
your question is very meaningful to your relationshipand the possible reasons are endlessit is definitely a topic which affects both of you you need to gently ask your boyfriend this question directly how you ask how he answers and the discussion or lack of discussion which follows will show a lot about the comfort you each feel being with each other and what conditions would improve the sex lifemedical rule out is always the first considerationbefore addressing in detail any topics of trust care love ways to express oneself sexually your boyfriend needs to know that here isnt some physical problem preventing him from having sex w youif he is told by his doctor that there is no medical reason then the two of you are free to talk about why he stops himself from having sex with you
if you are saying that he will not have sex with you but the rest of your relationship is as you would like it to be perhaps you can have a discussion about it there could be a difference in preferences perhaps you could give each other feedback regarding what you like and what you dont likeif there are other concerns in your relationship such as possibly needing to communicate better or trust each other more these concerns could be showing up related to your question about sex
hello and thank you for your question i am not sure that we can be much help since we know very little about your situation for example we dont know how old you are or if you have previously had a satisfying sex life so i will just name a few things that can impact someones interest in sex and some colleagues may add others there are quite a few things that can actually lead to disinterest or inability to have sex things such as depression illness anxietystress substance or alcohol abuse and relationship dissatisfaction are just a few reasons i work in a medical setting and you might be surprised by how many male patients have some kind of erectile dysfunction occurrence even in their 20s the best way to find out why he wont have sex is simply to ask guessing will likely not bring you to the actual truth and if you are dissatisfied about your sex life it is likely not to get better without take some kind of action step i suggest approaching your partner with compassion and concern he may also be aware that there is a problem and is afraid or embarrassed to talk to you about it if you do end up communicating you have some options to explore he may want to see his primary care provider if he believes it may be a health issue a vicious circle can develop about this topic a person has difficulty with sex for some reason which generates anxiety which can actually lead to more difficulty with sex counseling can be helpful some couples try something called the sensate focus method you can look it up online i am not suggesting it or indicating it will help but some people have said it is helpfulgood luck and be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
im always questioning her about things such as who she is texting and talking to on the phone why she is always on social media checking her phone records and going through her phone i do this knowing that i have never found any reason for her to be cheating and i have no reason to understand the reasons you feel mistrustful even though you arent finding evidence of cheating your weak sense of faith in your wifes behavior is worth examining bc trust is fundamental to a good relationshipit is possible you dont have faith in yourself to accurately tell whether someone is telling you the truth or whether you are interpreting evidence accuratelyanyone who has themselves had their trust severely violated will feel uneasy to naively trust what is on face valuethe work requires observing your own confidence in gradually feeling safe that what someone tells you is true is actually trueexamine as much evidence as needed of whether what the other person tells you theyre doing does in fact take placewhen the facts line up and show you no reason to be fearful then you will be one step closer to trusting yourself to trust someone else
so many people lie and its hard to tell who speaks the truth who do i trust i dont even trust my family or friends start by trusting yourselfthis is harder to do than it may soundif a person trusts themselves their actions decisions way of handling matters then evaluating whether or not to trust another human being becomes much easieralso dont be in a rush to trust someone trust takes time to develop first observe someone listen to the person whether they follow through repeat this process multiple times which requires time to accomplishat a certain point in this process you will start to feel whether or not the person is trustworthy or not
nothing weve tried has worked so far probably what you should do is decide whether you can continue having a romantic and sexual relationship with someone to whom you dont feel like having sexfive years is long enough to know that the way you feel toward your partner is more than likely going to remain this waytalk with your gf about your feelings because she may not wish to be in a relationship in which her partner is not sexually attracted to her
nothing weve tried has worked so far sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum if you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy you could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable after doing this for nonsexual touching it can also be used with sexual touching looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help
today my boyfriend broke up with me because he says i stress him out with me not trusting him and always accusing him of things it hit me that i still hold on to every bad thing my mother has ever said to me and everything that anyone has ever done to me i act as if hes going to do it too the relationship history with your mother was probably quite painful and left emotional hesitation to avoid similar dynamics with othersif you havent done so already then tell your bf about the difficulties you had with your mother and ask him to be sensitive to not trusting easilythe two of you can collaborate in creating more security in relating to him maybe he can tell you sooner about particular times he feels frustratedthen you will know and be able to address your own sore points and by handling these differently than through the years with your mom toward your bfyour process of feeling and thinking in terms familiar from your growing up years is normal each of us is this waythe difference is you know and would be willing to develop new patterns of relating to someone which is based on more care and trust than you knew growing up

he is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault he bashes me to our young child and he is addicted to a few substances strengthen your own belief in your right to a decent life and respect of who you arefrom the brief description you write your husband has very limited capacity to recognize how others feel and even less capacity to empathize with the personthe best you can do is convince yourself of your own worth and associate with others who believe similarly about your qualities
he is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault he bashes me to our young child and he is addicted to a few substances the behaviors you describe are boundary violations you can not change your spouse but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety this is very hard to do without support finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful if you are not ready to do this i recommend the book boundaries by dr henry cloud and dr john townsend its a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive
we cant hold a conversation together the blame is always pointed at me we have no intimacy it is hard to hold onto a partner that isnt available emotionally or is lashing out when you face any kind of coflict between youthe conditions needed for healthy intimacy can not grow when there is an absence of common ground or lack of a sense of safe space between youlearning to nurture yourself in this type of situation is vital and comes first if there are to be better conditions to grow the kind of relationship you both feel safe and valued in it needs to be a shared missionbut healthy intimacy begins within and you can grow and thrive no matter the willingness or emotional availability of another i recommend you find a good guide to walk this path back home to a deeper peace in you if the relationship can be healed more will become clear as you feel more ease and harmony within yourselffor more resources related to healthy inimacy i invite you to visit httpwwwcounseling4ocwomencom
we cant hold a conversation together the blame is always pointed at me we have no intimacy how recent is your awareness of a lack of intimacyif this is recent or sudden then the best road forward is have a conversation with your partner on the way you feeldepending on the result and whether youd like to try this conversation several times in order to see your partners receptivity to explain their side you will know how likely the lack of intimacy will continueif you are living with a lack of intimacy for what feels like a long time such as a few years and your partner is unwilling to talk with you about it then you may have reached the end of the road of intimacy returningwhether or not youd want to live this way becomes the next question
my spouse seems to get very bothered by me speaking asking questions or getting excited in a way that he thinks is too much he comes across as acting like whatever it is im talking about is nowhere near as important as whatever hes thinking about which he believes will go over my head good for you to realize you have just as much right to talk and be heard as he doesand that your words deserve as much respect as his doat a time which is relatively calm introduce the topic of your hurt feelings from his difficulty listening to you speakif it is so tell him you value his opinion and that when you talk there is no bad intention toward himask him to explain what bothers him so much about your manner of expressionthen as a mutual project both of you could develop a new system of talking with one another which avoids hurting your feelings and the distress he feels when he hears you talkthe above assumes good will by each of youit is also possible he simply has no interest in listening to you or to develop new understanding which makes doing so more likelythis possibility introduces an entirely new subject of how to live with someone who has no interest in you
he leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me he gets defensive when i ask him stuff we havent had sex in two months he says its because hes not working im pregnant he doesnt like it here and he hasnt been on the mood lately well there certainly is distance he creates between the two of youwhether or not the reason is from his cheating on you is impossible to tell based only on the information here providedyou could open a general discussion about the lack of closeness you feel maybe hell be more responsive to talk about emotions than about specific actions hes done or not donemostly entitle yourself to the quality relationship youd like to have your discomfort and distress are valid and theres no good reason to live with conditions which keep these moods in place forevergive yourself time to plan your next move especially since having a baby will add to each of your responsibilitiesyou didnt write how long the problem you describe has continuedone possible outcome if its been a short time is he will resolve whatever currently drives his withdrawn behaviors from youyour life your outcometrust yourself to know when the time is right to stay or to go
after receiving counseling we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder when i offer compromises in our disagreements he does not seem to understand we cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white my husband has asked that we go to counseling this time in the past it has been my suggestion we are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved he cannot see the whole picture when i attempt to explain my side to him i never heard of a marriage mediator beforesince you already went to counseling and the therapist observed your husbands tendency to see black and white in life and because counseling functions on a deeper level than a mediator generally does a marriage mediator sounds like a step backwardswhy not go to a financial mediatorthis would satisfy your husbands black white outlook and may satisfy you too because no emotions are expected in financial discussion and the relationship suffers from an expectations surrounding emotion
i have been married for ten years my husband is 29 years my senior we have a young daughter ever since she was born my husband has shut down we have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me ive told him how i feel for years and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy but i still have to literally beg for sex and affection my selfesteem is gone and i feel so alone he has stranded me he uses his passiveaggressive ways and ignores every comment i make he refuses to talk to me in detail hi smyrnayour husband is avoiding dealing with this problem i understand how lonely you must feel not only sexually but emotionally toofrom what you describe it seems that he wants to be there for you but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue my hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you but i think he does have something to sayyour husband is 29 years older and youve been together for ten yearsthat puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormonerelated low sex drive as they age its possible that your husband is bewildered angry grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this he may feel like hes letting you down and hes scared it will get worse so hes sticking his head in the sand of course that doesnt help does itthe worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame eventually you stop chasing him and you drift further apart its a bit of a conundrumhow to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities maybe lower your expectations for a bit your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared and that hes not rejecting youjust protecting himselfi would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like sweetheart we both know that somethings not right here i think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better but can we agree that its not i need you to either talk to me about whats happening or please go see a doctor what i need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us either of those things would show me thatin the end you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way if he does neither then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage i wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help just a thought
with college over my boyfriend and i have such different work schedules since i cant see him often i want to talk more on the phone he plays video games while talking to players so often i feel ignored i find myself always telling him what to do in relation to me things he should know directly tell him what you write hereeither he is losing interest in you or he is simply caught up in short fun w his friends and video gamesa conversation on this subject will give you more clarity on your question
ive pretty much been on my own since day one im a middle child of five and i cant seem to put my trust in anyone it took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend every time i realize that i have feelings for someone i freak out and never talk to them again i really want some help one way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention backstart with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer onesonce you start seeing your success this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentratethe task of selfreminding is the same whether for long or short time periodsalso before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problemif there is then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate and not some medical reason preventing thisbefore someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work
i was with my friends at the park and we were talking and having fun after a while i met a girl there we talked and flirted for a while then we gave our numbers to each other and left we talked for a few months then we met up again she kissed me so i assumed we were dating then i found out she has a boyfriend im sorry for your disappointment with this girlmaybe next time you start to like someone talk with the person to find out if they feel similar to you this way you have a good chance to avoid being hurt in the way you describe hereeven if the person doesnt give you a straightforward answer to their feelings for you youll gain a little more information by listening to how seriously they consider your question what their body language is like whether or not the person seems sincerelisten to your gutif you feel unsure the person likes you as much as you like them then wait a little while to see if your feelings about the person or their feelings about you change and in what direction they changekeep yourself informed as best you can so youll know you did as much as possible to kiss someone who understands your kiss the way you mean it to be understood
hes gone for 11 weeks for a band camp its week two right now we used to be intimate a lot and now since hes busy 12 hours a day we cant really be intimate even over the phone is it normal for me to more sensitive in general well yes physical intimacy does give all sorts of positive feelings the sudden withdrawal of these is certainly possible to trigger a reaction like the one you describe
my husband had an emotional affair with his exwife in november she invited him to dinner alone with their daughter i wasnt aware of this until after 11pm when i asked where he was he had been drinking and i told him not to come home that night the next morning we talked about going to counseling he went out that night with friends and said his exwife wasnt going i found out in april that she did go i gave him the chance to get everything out in the open i found out that he stayed that second night with her i asked if they slept in the same bed and he said yes both nights his daughter wasnt there the second night he claims they didnt have sex but what else should i think i agree with you that professional counseling is a wise choice for your relationshipyour husband may not know want to know or want to discuss with you what his true feelings are toward you and the exthe topic is very heated which is why discussing these matters alone may do more harm than goodusually people start deeply complex emotional matters discussion and get so upset the conversation goes off track and unintended hurts happenin a therapist office the two of you will be guided on talking about these critical areas and this will be much more productive than trying to do so only with the two of you

shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family we dont talk much because of it also we have little fights we want to work it out but we dont know how maybe your girlfriend feels torn in her emotions between loyalty toward her family and toward investing herself in a relationshipthere are so many maybes that the best way to strengthen your relationship is to ask your girlfriend if she feels any pressure from her family to avoid involving herself with youif the answer is no then continue to talk with each other as to what would make you each feel more secure with one anotheralso more simply are the two of you able to resolve the little fightsdifferences of opinion are normal between two people even to the point of each person feeling they are the only one who knows the correct answeras long as each one of you has the goodwill to give a little then the fights are a healthy way to respect and care about each otherif the fights are about the same topic which repeats itself then there are strong differences between the two of you including the possibility that her family places and she is willing to accept some obstacle to this relationship
shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family we dont talk much because of it also we have little fights we want to work it out but we dont know how maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other even if it needs to be on the phone because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time at least you would know there was that time that was set aside that may also help you to rekindle some conversations between youas far as your little fights consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are openended cannot be answered with just yes or no and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing then once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch its also good to restate what you think you are hearing then you know what each other is truly following about this also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming fromalso consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated think of the same for your girlfriend this could be a great discussion to have as well
i went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide when i went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that i put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders he was very angry that i went to him to do that am i in the wrong for going to him to reach out he helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why i thought of him to reach out he made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help why did he react this way towards me i think hes being selfish your compassionate reach out to the friend is praiseworthythat your ex bf has trouble accepting your gesture as kindness shows your ex bf is not seeing the situation clearlyi believe your ex bfs words about feeling burdened by your actionhowever he is mixing up his own responsibility to know the root of his feelingsblaming you for feelings he doesnt understand within himself is unfair and not helpful to anyone including himfrom what you write you did nothing wrong and your action toward the potential suicider was graciousmy only guess which is also very general about your ex bfs behavior is that he doesnt yet fully understand himself and finds blaming others easier than understanding himself
i went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide when i went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that i put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders he was very angry that i went to him to do that am i in the wrong for going to him to reach out he helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why i thought of him to reach out he made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help why did he react this way towards me i think hes being selfish im glad you think so highly of your boyfriend and his ability to be there when you would like to talk about things that are important to youi see why you would want them to reach out i also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out it sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friends wellbeing although i cant say that for certainwould you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes five minutes or so you ask him about what made him react that way during this time try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience you can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does this does not mean that you have to agree with what you say but just that you follow i hear you saying that you think hes being selfish im suggesting that just during this conversation you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling in one sentence the goal would be to learn more about his experiencei would not be at all surprised if he is scaredare you aware of what kind of support he wants through this time
he told me he started to back away because i was asking for too much in the relationship the more i tried to fix things the worse it got i want to make us better again but i dont know how have you asked your boyfriend directly this questionit is a good question and possibly would open a necessary clarifying discussion as to what each of you expects from the other
do you know whether the reason your wife is sexually passive and insecure is due to your fetishesmaybe shed be very turned on by your fetishestry to not mix up your hesitancy to speak about your fetishes which she hasnt yet directly heard from you with your assumption that her sexual passivity necessarily means she will reject or withdraw from you when you speak of your fetishes to her
thank you for asking your question when i read terms like fetishes and that your wife is sexually passive and insecure i cant help but wonder that there may be more going on within the coupleship and with yourself than what has been asked about in your particular question i invite you to enter into an exploratory journey with an experienced therapist to identify your fetishes and the deeper story behind the who what when where how and why they are important to you additionally consider whether or not you need these fetishes as a requirement or strongly preferred for sexual excitement and in its absence do you find yourself being sexually avoidant with your spouse or suffering from some form of erectile dysfunction while the fetishes may not be causing you clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning it seems from your question that they might or would cause distress to your wife an experienced clinician could help you and your wife to navigate through this relational terrain ensuring all are heard and that the coupleship is honored best wishes
my boyfriend has this close female friend it always bothered me because of how close they are so i decided to meet her that made the situation worse because they were even closer than what i thought they acted like a couple rather than friends with each other there was no physical interaction but he talks to this girl a lot what can i do leaving him isnt an option i wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling a few things may help with thattry having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important for example not during a commercial for a tv showmaybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience kind of like an investigative reporter wouldsee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what youre saying by summarizing it for youremember that hearing you and following what youre saying does not mean that he agreesalso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current onesthen you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing for example what it is that he likes about heralso consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame usually between 15 minutes and one hour and then come back to continue the discussionremember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through not to find a solution right awaythis can be difficult consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together
my boyfriend has this close female friend it always bothered me because of how close they are so i decided to meet her that made the situation worse because they were even closer than what i thought they acted like a couple rather than friends with each other there was no physical interaction but he talks to this girl a lot what can i do leaving him isnt an option well as hurtful as witnessing your boyfriends closeness with his female friend im glad you saw firsthand the dynamic of your concernthere isnt anything you can directly do to stop his relationship with this ladyit is possible to influence his side of their relationshipdirectly telling him your discomfort with how close the two are may make him pause before engaging with her in a discussion this is nothing to count on since the control is in his hands and not yoursim sorry to read that the option to leave this relationship is out of the questionthe only way left is to get used to the fact that you dont like this aspect of your boyfriend and this is a disheartening outlook overall to you and to your relationship overallif after repeated effort to influence him by your opinions your effort to adjust to a situation you dont like if at all possible consider a longterm plan to discontinue this relationship because by that time it may feel very oppressive in your life
if you are ready for marriage and he isnt then ask him his reasons and what his terms would be for making the decision to marrythis way youll know if he ever would like to be married and if the terms he states are similar enough to yours that this relationship is worth continuingalso marriage means living one life together so it is good practice for the two of you to have discussions on the deeper and more intimate concerns of your lives
i dont know if you have any details regarding what makes him say he is not ready for marriageit may also be helpful to look at what is making marriage so important to you right nowmaybe this is something around which you could have a conversation where you each listen to each other for about five minutes and try to ask questions about what the other person is experiencing to gain more clarity about what is happening this particular type of conversation wouldnt be about reaching a certain solution but just understanding more about yourselves and each other i also recommend prefacing that conversation with asking if the person is open to having a discussion that is important at that timeif this proves to be a difficult discussion consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples even if only one of you goes to see a counselor you may have some clarificationin the meantime try to look at what you have that makes you feel valued special and loved perhaps you can look at the things that make your boyfriend feel that way as well
im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do hello and thank you for your question when faced with these kinds of difficult challenges i usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions what kind of person do i want to be deep in my heart what kind of character do i want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching how would i want others to describe me lets say that you want others to see you as being authentic and you also value authenticity as something you want to live by you may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now that you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart this is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation so please try not to feel alone we all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc and i am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a very hard time accepting themselves thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but i wont lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time for example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove that may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity it may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them i would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are both as an individual and as someones fiancéabove all i wish you well in this journey robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do i would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner such as is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship

my boyfriend lost his dad to suicide he says that because his dad died so did his heart he says that he cant be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again why is he doing this when we were very happy together he says that i have done nothing wrong but he just cant be with me i am sorry to learn of this you must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken to begin he is correct you have done nothing wrong this is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive it is fear it is anger it is extreme sadness it is feelings of abandonment it is intense emotional pain it is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional lossi am not familiar with how old this post is but often it will require time and understanding if he speaks with you encourage him to get grief counseling do not encourage it for your relationship encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad start there good luck
ever since my exboyfriend and i broke up i cant seem to get close to anyone else i know im completely over him but i just cant break down my walls and let someone new into my life hi bend youre scared right that makes sense each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business we are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines 90 of our happiness in life the good news is that when were just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow i think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here and thats okay we are naturally people of attachment and it wont likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesnt put up walls so part of what i want to say here is dont pressure yourself too much take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow as well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right person first think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship what do you feel proud of what do you need in a partner what mistakes did you make use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partnerlook at your thoughts are you having generalized negative thoughts like no one will ever love me again or im going to get hurt again or i cant trust myself if so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening it sells us a line based on no concrete evidence then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought what is the evidence that i am lovable that there are safe good people out there that i can trust myself eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones its simple but very powerfullastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls what is the evidence of the walls can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls when we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it morei hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time 
when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes you are in an abusive relationshipnot because of your boyfriends silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful never admits he is wrong and never apologizes it is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship you can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner you can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship i wish you well always
when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes this has to be very difficult to endureits pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like i cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hoursmy best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is it could even be that hes learned to handle conflict that waysomething else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not these sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couplesas far as what you can do now perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before that you love him and believe that he loves you or some other statements that are true for you you may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself for example you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure
when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes as you say if he does reply it is hurtful but if he doesnt reply it sounds like its just as hurtful though more in my opinion in terms of the longerrange effects on the relationship the behavior he is exhibiting would easily pass for passiveaggression as it is manipulative and controlling through passive withdrawal behaviors and i can assure you that you are not alone in struggling with how to deal with it so many do and thats why it gets done so often because it can for example if you push for connection he stonewalls even more you probably become more distressedfrankly if you and your boyfriend were sitting on my couch in therapy id likely say that the behavior needs to stop in order for the relationship to continue because of how severe it sounds an hour of withdrawal because someone cant deal is reasonable as everyone can shut down from time to time but this feels extreme and is extremely hurtful to you i might even say to him that the behavior needs to stop if he ever wants to be in a healthy loving connected relationship because the amount that you describe him disconnecting severely hurts trust and security one of the first change events in emotionallyfocused couples therapy is for the person doing the withdrawing to be able to use words and communication to help the partner understand what they are experiencing so the burden does fall more on him at the beginning it becomes the partners job to tolerate though whatever his experience isthere is no one tried and true solution to working with passiveaggression but i would most advise limitsetting like i would do in our session in one way shape or form in order for the behavior to stop there has to be consequences to it the more you tolerate it and allow him to come back to you when hes done with his silent tantrum the more you encourage the behavior because he is getting what he wants
when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes try during a good moment between you to tell him youd like to talk over something about your relationship and that youd like to set a time with him to do sowhen a person shuts down and withdraws the only choice is to withdraw yourself if this continues on a regular basis after a while the two of you will become increasingly distant and have developed the very unhappy habit of not clearing the air between the two of yougood for you to recognize a problem and be willing to address it
when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes this sounds very hurtful for you to be on the receiving end of this you can ask yourself  what am i learning from the way i am being treated  and consider whether or not this is in fact either 1 a message or value that you agree with and believe will strengthen your relationship and help you to grow as a person or 2 a message or value that is damaging to the relationship or to your view of your self and others once youve considered that and come to your own conclusion you will likely know what you need to do if youre still stuck you may want to consider seeing an individual therapist for yourself to process your feelings about the relationship or a couples therapist with your partner to work on improving your communication with each other
my husband cheated while i was pregnant with our son with a socalled friend this was before we were married we split and eventually worked things out i thought i trusted him so we got married now he flirts with girls in front of me ive talked to him but nothing helps this sounds very painful for youare you able to tell him how his flirting affects youmaybe he doesnt care enough to change and maybe he doeslong term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices put up with it which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship or of course you can decide to end the relationship this choice is quite significant now that you have a child together give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome
the father of my kids and i have been broken up for about three years now we always found our way back to each other he had a baby with someone else hes with but still shows the same love he showed when we was together when hes around he even gets jealous but he ignores my calls your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointmentyou know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship youd likeit is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothingreflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wishdepending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been
every day for five years my husband mentally abused me and said he will change i have a child with him i try so hard to stay strong for her but at this point i am completely broken i am holding on to nothing but hope and have been for years is there any hope or am i wasting my time i think your own awareness will not allow you to continue in a bad relationshipbe glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband doesfor support and guidance in real time look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationshipsyou are not the first or only one and probably not the last woman who wants to leave an abusive partner having guidance particular to you and your situation will help you move through what decisions to make as to how to leave this man
my boyfriend and i have been disagreeing on a lot lately its really coming down to the fact that we want opposite things sometimes i do a lot for him i take care and protect him and in the end he still doesnt trust me weve both come to the conclusion that when i want something and he doesnt want it hes not willing to find a happy medium whatsoever its just nonnegotiable im not sure what to do honestly he doesnt trust me as much as i wish he did honestly sometimes i feel like his enemy and it kills me theres a difference between what you want what you need and what you have being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectivelyyou could use couples mediation to learn assertive communication skills and filter the information needed to resolve or negotiate a solution mi novio no transa conmigoúltimamente mi novio y yo hemos tenido muchos desacuerdos todo se debe al hecho de que queremos cosas diferentes yo hago mucho por él lo cuido y protejo y al final el no confía en mí ambos hemos llegado a la conclusión que cuando yo quiero algo que él no quiere él no está dispuesto a encontrar el punto medio no es negociable no estoy segura de que hacer el no confía en mi tanto como quisiera que lo hiciera a veces siento su enemiga y eso me mata hay una gran diferencia entre lo que quieres lo que necesitas y lo que tienes poder identificar y expresar asertivamente lo que quieres y necesitas en tu relación te ayudara en los momentos de negociación muchas veces las parejas se enfocan en recontar todos los problemas y características negativas a la hora de negociar y eso les impide hablar claramente del problema presente e identificar soluciones específicaspueden usar la mediación de parejas para aprender técnicas de comunicación asertiva y tener asistencia filtrando e identificando la información que les ayudara a resolved o negociar una solución al problema
i have been pushing people away all my life i finally have a great boyfriend who loves me but i keep pushing him away and i dont want to i need to learn to open up figuring out the space we need between ourselves and others is an ongoing and unsolvable task but it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life or it may be serving some other purpose one helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the pushing away is serving it also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction what were you feeling right before this did it provide relief reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the pushing away servesit may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times this may help him be as sensitive as you need him to be about the pace of the relationship and to understand what may be happening when you push him away
i have been dating my boyfriend for eight years we met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when i met his family who treats him like he is their man they expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around and he thinks its okay well then you learned something new about your boyfriendare you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying togetherthink over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationshipthere are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationshipthe key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to livealso an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion he may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you
hes lied about his pastpresent situations since time has passed he has changed but i still have my doubts i have no idea if i should stay or go but i hate this feeling i dont trust him all too much but yet he hasnt done anything for me not to trust him recently your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him againotherwise how would you actually know whether hes lying to you now or notstart the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truthif he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past
good questionthe starting point is to directly tell the person you dont trust them your reason for this and what you feel is necessary in order for the person to regain your trustsince the person broke your trust then this person is the one who must earn it backoften the one who was lied to will like to ask many questions about matters which usually wouldnt even come upas long as your dating person is willing to accept their responsibility to earn back your trust then the person would naturally understand and be willing to answer your questionsit is not too hard to see that if someone lies then they are the one who must show themselves to be worthy of being believed again
my fiancé of 15 years is always helping out his family and i feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness were about to get married this saturday but i feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids i am not enjoying our engagement at all congrats on your upcoming weddinghave you told the thoughts you write here to your fiancé this is the place to start since you clearly are unhappy with a part of his and now your life which will be with you for quite some time
the eight months ive been dating my boyfriend i have lied about a lot of things i slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me now anything i say to him he wont believe even if im being honest i dont know what else to do at this point he constantly criticizes me start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trustask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you againif you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you then after a few months of this both of you should feel more secure in the relationship
someone i care about told me im not teachable and im irritating i just want to be happy and wanted to please the person but i always fall short it seems pleasing someone certainly does feel satisfying if the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfyingoffering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe heretell the person that you are trying to please them and also tell the person that their comments are hurtfulif the person said their words with no bad intentions then next time they comment its reasonable to expect these comments to not hurt your feelingskeep in mind that your good intentions may not be received in the way you intend them some people sometimes are insensitive or just plain not interested in being pleased by another person
ive been in a relationship for almost a year and i absolutely trust my boyfriend he treats me nice checks on me and tells me sweet things however when it comes to making life decisions i feel he is very immature i try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting as far as dates if i dont say anything plan it or have money to chip in we will not go i feel like i put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling and all i get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion well then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or notone point to keep in mind is thisjust because hes not telling you his opinions doesnt mean he doesnt have any opinionsin the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesnt tell you what is in their mindshort term it seems easy to have someone agreeablelong term someone who doesnt tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways
my best friend and ive been really close for almost three years she lives in the uk and i live in the us ever since her boyfriend flew from oregon to scotland ive been angry at him ever since he came into her life he took her away from me my best friend would always say sorry and im sick of it you are definitely in a frustrating situationyour friend and the boyfriend are doing what is natural for couples who are in the early stage of their relationship being almost inseparable to the point of overlooking friends is understandable as long as it doesnt continue for long enough that friends feel hurtif you feel you would like to one more time tell your friend that you miss your friendship with her and would like her attention then do soafter expressing your needs as much as possible and if the result doesnt change then the sad conclusion is that your friend is willing to give you less time and energy than you require from her
i found the guy im dating on dating websites he was telling women that they were beautiful he said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked it has since happened two other times he says he loves me and im the only girl he wants to be with but i feel he is not telling me the truth tell him what you know and ask why he is lying to you if he tells you he isnt lying and you have proof that he is then you can either accept that he denies the truth or not
i found the guy im dating on dating websites he was telling women that they were beautiful he said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked it has since happened two other times he says he loves me and im the only girl he wants to be with but i feel he is not telling me the truth i would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create for example you may want a relationship where honesty listening compassion and romanticism are major parts you could also see what your boyfriend wantsyou may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking openended questions not being answered with yes or no and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right after that perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking openended questionsremember that it takes two people to have a relationship so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have
did she tell you her reason for thisif not then ask her for her reasoningalso please tell your wife that you would like to celebrate your anniversary tighter with her maybe she doesnt know this
my boyfriend wont touch me intimately he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me i know he has done this things with other women in the past i dont know why he wont do them with me what should i do first off dont blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times eg what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time there could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxietymaybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner thats left him scared to try again we call this operant conditioning it could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers sometimes i refer to this as the hookerhousewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal drives many partners crazy until theyre aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them it could also be that hes not even aware that hes not doing these things if you havent asked him yet you might try gently approaching the subject when youre not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you or has enjoyed in the past or thinks he might enjoy you can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if hed be down to go downtown baby it really turns me on when you kiss me during sexif you continue to get the impression that its somehow only about you or that hes just really hesitant to talk about sex in general you might see if hed be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy
my boyfriend wont touch me intimately he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me i know he has done this things with other women in the past i dont know why he wont do them with me what should i do ask himhaving a conversation about sexual satisfaction increases emotional intimacynot only will you potentially feel more deeply connected from a sincere conversation about your sexual questions maybe this increased emotional closeness will inspire the sexual closeness you wish to receive
he said that if i were to visit my mother he will be gone when i get back my boyfriend and i hit a rough patch in our relationship a few months back and my mom had a few choice words with him your boyfriend and you have a separate relationship than your relationship with your mother by trying to control whether or not you visit your mom unless you are in agreement with this is building tension between you and himask why he resents your interest to see your motherif he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward himif something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother
my wife and i got separated because i asked about her contact with a male friend of hers the next day she kicked me out she let me move back two days later yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind i asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business when threats of leaving such as what you described in your question kicking you out wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship impacting both partners and if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship from the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship if your wife is willing i would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time or for you to talk with an individual therapist if marriage counseling isnt an option

im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about think about it for a minute do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female coworkers your husband has and if so what does that say about your marriage trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with its also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common if you are focused on every little detail around your relationship it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more if instead you focus on opening the lines of communication let him know what you expect from him and discuss how you could both build trust again you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow debería este molesta porque mi esposo me mintió de nuevoestoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione después de una separación antes de separarnos el mentía mucho y rompía todas sus promesas no creo que me haya sido infiel el mes pasado le pregunté cuantas mujeres trabajan con él y él me dijo ayer me enteré que se olvido de una muchacha debería estar enojadaquieres estar molesta porque se le olvido con cuantas mujeres trabaja piénsalo por un momento quieres determinar la confianza que le tienes en tu esposo basándote en su capacidad de reportar la cantidad de mujeres que trabajan con él si tu respuesta es sí qué refleja eso sobre tu matrimonio la confianza es algo que se gana basado en nuestras acciones y las de aquellos con quienes interactuamos también en nuestra habilidad de comunicar y entender los valores que tenemos en común si practicas estar preocupada por cada pequeño detalle en tu relación esto se puede convertir en una obsesión que potencialmente dañara tu relación si en cambio te enfocas en abrir las líneas de comunicación le dejas saber lo que esperas de él y discuten cómo pueden trabajar juntos para recuperar la confianza pueden volverse más cercanos y darse la oportunidad de que la relación crezca

im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset is really difficult to tell whether he honestly forgot about someone or whether he was really lying againi dont know whether he would be open to having a discussion with you about your concerns about this and whether you would be actually willing to listen to your thoughts about itthis might be something to discuss with a local therapist so that you can look at the patterns of lying in the past as well as whether you have a way to discuss this with your husband in the way that you would feel comfortable feeling vulnerable with your own feelings and also listening to what his responses arethis is difficult because i imagine you have a react very quickly and strongly to things like this because of what has happened in the past between you all of this make sense having said that there is also a question of whether he is telling the truth in this particular case and your reaction is based on past eventstheres no easy way to knowif you do decide to have a discussion with your husband about it consider these thingsask if this is a good time to have a conversation about something that is important to youmaybe you will be able to listen and ask questions about what came up for him emotionally when he realized that he didnt tell you about this other personmaybe he would be willing to listen to what you are thinking about if you are both able to do so without blaming pointing fingers or asking the other person to change this would just be an exchange of information ideally this part of the competition would not be about you saying he did something wrong but just expressing how you felt when you heard about itit may be helpful to discuss these things with a therapist first so you have some coping skills for being able to listen to him without being overly defensive and also expressing your feelings without blaming both of which would be very natural in this situation
im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset i would ask you first what made you give him another chance after he repeatedly lied and broke every promise to you i would imagine if he repeatedly lied to you that it will damage your ability to trust him now is he in therapy does he recognize that he has a problem and is he trying to repair it even if he truly forgot to tell you about the woman at work i think the real issue here is trust i am not saying that he doesnt have a lying problem instead of asking someone else if you should be upset ask yourself how you truly feel about him and this situation
im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset are you upset is the more pertinent questioneveryone has their own tolerance for lies and their unique reasons for being married trust your own answers to the question you ask herealso think over the value of your marriage in your life and whether you are able to live with the unstable sense of trust that you have in your husbandremember too that if you are the only partner who is trying to make the marriage work then your job is much harder than if your husband actively participated in making the marriage happier for the couple
my fiancée is always letting me know how i am a horribleevil person or i just dont care enough when its about her feeling or when she is having an off day i dont know much about the dynamics of your relationship but i want to say that you cannot possibly be responsible for anyone elses happiness if you are interested in a good read on this topic i highly recommend the four agreements by don miguel ruiz
my fiancée is always letting me know how i am a horribleevil person or i just dont care enough when its about her feeling or when she is having an off day one thing you could try is to have a conversation when neither of you is upset so that you learn what makes each of you feel cared for and valued it could be that you are showing caring in a way that doesnt quite match what she is really looking for in that moment for example having an indepth conversation could be something that you want but she may just want a hug in that moment i dont know if you heard of gary chapmans book about love languages but it may be helpful
my fiancé and i recently had an argument over finances he gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance he no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy he realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why i was allowing him to continue to do that since i was physically paying it for him my response was that he was giving me the money and i just made the payment i didnt think of the coverages he was angry about it i still cant figure out that anger id be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per sewhat you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilitiesstart by withdrawing yourself from paying his billsif he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy then surely the only one for him to blame will be himselfstay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountabletell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you
my fiancé and i recently had an argument over finances he gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance he no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy he realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why i was allowing him to continue to do that since i was physically paying it for him my response was that he was giving me the money and i just made the payment i didnt think of the coverages he was angry about it i still cant figure out that anger a few things come to mind i wonder if your fiancé is still angry about it or if he was angry in that moment and has now worked through itit sounds like there was also a difference in expectations here you were just paying the bill with the money he was giving to you and he may have assumed you were reading it you thought that you were following his directions it could be that you could have a discussion about it but that depends on how much of a hot button issue it still is for either of youif youre going to talk about it i might suggest asking whether this would be a good time to have a discussion about what happened with the automobile insurance so that you can both use the opportunity to learn more about yourselves and each other around this particular issue

we have been together over a year we spend time together every day no matter how busy he started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight he also began to be distant and sexually selfish we had a argument and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer he wont treat it i wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want wish for and desire from one another right now that doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wantsyou may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one anotheri would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends with him considering doing the same so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone elseit may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones
we have been together over a year we spend time together every day no matter how busy he started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight he also began to be distant and sexually selfish we had a argument and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer he wont treat it hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry about this lifealtering situation that both you and your boyfriend are going through to be sure this is a devastating and lonely road for both of you i say lonely because when things like this happen we often dont know what to say to each other and so we suffer in silence with little supporthere are a few thoughts that i am having and perhaps others will add things too1 by the sound of your main question it seems like you have every intention to be there for your boyfriend during this difficult time i am not sure if he is willing to talk about his health situation but letting him know that you want to support him and also need his support may be helpful 2 if it is possible see if he would be willing to go to a counselor with you there are many things that a counselor could focus on that may help your relationship but also help you both cope with what is happening3 if he refuses to seek support you may want to consider going on your own if you cant afford it sometimes hospice organizations offer support groups and other services it is very important not to neglect yourself be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
im in a relationship with my childs father im a really jealous person we dont go out or do anything with other people because of me to keep our relationship going i know i have to stop being jealous but i cant how can i get over these issues it may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than getting over it if youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous i dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your pastalso it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other at least to some degreealso consider what you may want from your childs father to assist you with this you cannot make him do anything to support you with this but you can certainly askwhat is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal
im in my early 20s and ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now my boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently he has made comments such as you would look better as a tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats its really hurtful my first thought was that i wondered what changed recently is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that oneits possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts youtry asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important i dont know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly then you can listen to his side of the concern
im in my early 20s and ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now my boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently he has made comments such as you would look better as a tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats its really hurtful hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that you are experiencing this to be honest this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive and you likely know that already the unfortunate truth is there is very little we can actually do to change another adults behavior if they are not interested in changing it many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say or even believe that they are helping in some way by telling you how to improve yourself what is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive it is important to know that this kind of behavior doesnt necessarily show up right away that is why i am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors some people actually dont see them until they are already married you didnt mention that there has been any physical abuse but i would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with what you do and how you dress etc these are just more examples of emotional abuse and control here are some things to consider and some ideas1 you could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior if you believe it is safe to do so perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay and change if not then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship given the fact that you cannot force him to change 2 you can call a local domestic violence program they do not only work with people who have been physically abused or have been married they are trained to talk about emotional abuse also it may be a good thing for support your calls are confidential 3 check out the wheel in the link below on it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship if any of these are happening to you or begin to happen talking to a domestic violence program a trusted friend or family member or a counselor would be a good idea httpwwwdomesticviolencewilmorgportals97imagesviolence_wheelgif be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
my girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriendslovers on facebook who actively like and comment on posts it causes me to get jealous because im afraid they might reconnect somehow ive attempted to talk to her about it but she avoids it and doesnt seem to worry about how i feel about it talking about it would probably be helpful if youre both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important it may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time you can adjust the timing for what works for both of you after one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say this can lessen confusioni know you say that she avoids it it might be a good place to start talking about it  to see what makes her avoid it it could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cant talk to them i dont know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well
she works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out i wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about this can often change the way that we look at different situations try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings beforeif you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you then you could talk about feelings that youre having
my wife works late most days so im lonely i love my wife with all my heart however i dont feel the intimacy we used to have we dont have sex anymore which bothers me tremendously i have become close friends with a coworker which i know is not helping nothing will happen with that but theres the thought first things first friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support but also become confusing theres sexual attraction and entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target careful with that friendship you do not want to fill your marriages void with another person even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person you may be developing a special bond sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship like thatthen try to refocus on your marriage i suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns ask her what you could do to reconnect make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them make time in both of your schedules make an effort to have lunch together or to text during the day remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits but sometimes the responsibility kills the funcómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposami esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días la amo con todo mi corazón pero no siento la intimidad como antes ya no tenemos sexo lo cual me molesta tremendamente me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo lo cual no ayuda nada pasara pero hay pensamientos al respectoprimero lo primero las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande ten cuidado con esa amistad no quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona puedes estar creando una conexión especial compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad asíintenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos y comunicarse durante el día aunque sea con textos recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversión

my boyfriend and i have been going out for about a year i suddenly find myself jealous when i see him talking to other girls i have never been this way before i dont like these feelings he said that my jealousy would cause our relationship to have problems i told him i cant help these feelings i dont know where they are coming from but this is how i feel i tried to stop but i cant i really like this guy but im afraid that im messing up the relationship its just stupid trust is at the top of what makes a healthy relationship it sounds like you may benefit from personal counseling to explore where this jealousy comes from and what keeps you from having complete trust in your boyfriend this is not stupid this is your mind telling you that there is something that needs to be worked through sometimes we need to talk to someone like a counselor who is disconnected from our life to understand our feelings and what they mean in our relationships
weve been dating for two months now i have a heavy past that gets him angry does he have a right to penalize me for things i did before i met him not in my book youre only two months in at this early stage this is a bit of a warning sign if he cant accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions youve made theres already a level of discomfort here that shouldnt be ignored no he doesnt have the right to penalize you or punish you not just for past thingsnot for anything what he does get to do it tell you how it affects him sureif he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurancelisten to those things but if he doesnt dig who you are maybe he can walk the other way
weve been dating for two months now i have a heavy past that gets him angry does he have a right to penalize me for things i did before i met him how is he penalizing youhave you asked for his reasons for wanting to know about your heavy pasthis answers may be very different than that he would like penalizing youwhat you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questionsideally the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other
my husband and i are in our 40s weve been married 17 years three weeks ago he said he loves me but is not in love with me he was going to leave me but he said he thought about it and decided to stay i dont know how to feel any more how should i take what he said and not feel so hurt he has been very blunt and hurtful words just come out of his mouth he makes me feel like im nothing but i so dearly love him with everything in me he said it wasnt a midlife crisis i get it your husband tells you that hes not in love with you but oops hes changed his mind and will tolerate you for a while longer excuse me my dear its okay if you expect more than that from a marriage maybe the question has shifted from whether he is happy in the marriage to whether you are happy in the marriage you say you love this man who makes you feel like nothing i say it might be time to sit down with an individual therapist and look objectively at your marriage and whether its working for you

we dont have sex a lot i cheat when we argue i dont kiss or have unprotected sex with them its a one time thing and i never see them twice hello and thank you for your question the question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you however here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
1
do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals this is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy if you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that however if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright finally if you value your husbands feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values that can only be determined by you
2 based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is from the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument this
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt we can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep the pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs
3 what are your goals for this relationship if we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed none
of which requires any intimacy at all are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
4
have you considered seeking marital counseling not
having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them if there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed
hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship i certainly
wish you well

i am a female and i am afraid of having sex i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced i think he thinks im not a virgin i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex these fears are completely normal almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience men also feel far more of these fears than you realize that can helpto remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approvalyou mention a partner but im not sure if you currently have one having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important when youre really confident someone cares deeply for you this can help the fears to go away or diminish how well do you know your own body getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feelgetting acquainted with your body yourself firstthis can help build sexual confidence in general our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear asideironically this is what makes you good in bed but be patient with yourself your confidence will grow with experience and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready theres not rush 
i am a female and i am afraid of having sex i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced i think he thinks im not a virgin i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex as hard as it may be to do this since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually surrounds us keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product is meant to trigger fantasiesno one is a fantasy we are all real and unique we can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is genuinelyyour partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience than you are of yourselfsex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one not because they have ideal bodies and expertise but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they lovewhen you are in a loving relationship part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items
i am a female and i am afraid of having sex i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced i think he thinks im not a virgin i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex the greatest sex experience will be with someone who you feel connected to outside the bed this is something that you should feel comfortable in talking with your partner about the relationship needs to be strong before moving to the bed anyways if the love is there he will understand your fears and make you feel comfortable making it a great experience
i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like i dont think theres anything that youre supposed to feel some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all it could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions when something we do is hiddena secretits easier to avoid feeling guilty i wonder if youre avoiding your own emotions but lets put that question aside for now there are better questionswhat do you want do you want your marriage if not this may be why you dont feel guilty do you want to be able to sleep with your friend its unlikely that both are possible keeping the marriage and the affair yes you get to do whatever you want with your bodyandthere may be consequences affairs almost always get discovered who do you want to be what kind of partner do you want to be what might your partner feel if they knew how might you feel then would you care has something happened thats affected how much you care about your partneri suggest that these other questions might be a place to start exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe i wish you the best as you sort it out 
i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like my questions to you would be why did you get married would it bother you if your spouse did the same to you
i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like yes of course its your body and you can do what you feel like doingdo you feel a commitment to your partneryour guilt probably is pointing out the feeling of having done with your body what your spirit tells you is a violation of the commitment you feel toward your partnerthe good news is that this is a moment for you to examine how strong your commitment is to your partnerfind balance between satisfying your freedom to do as you please with your sense of being a partner which means prioritizing the partner once in a while
as i was growing up my mother and father always fought with that i grew trust issues i think its going to affect my relationship now and end it sooner then i want to i try not to let it affect me but i cant if you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship dont allow their problems to become your problem you didnt mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them like in the court of law if no evidencefind not guilty dont make them pay the consequences as if guilty of your parents unhealthy behavior
we had our first kid 15 years ago and sex has been nonexistent ever since it only happens every three or four months we have been to counseling and i have been told over and over again she will come around she hasnt and im intimately lonely i think its time to move on but how do i do that without hurting my kids hi pocahontas this is a painful situation when youre in a relationship you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection when it dries up its a very lonely place its possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship its also possible that your partner has hormonal issues pain issues sexual dysfunction or is asexual there is no one answer here only you can decide what is right for you but let me ask some questions to help you explore next stepsaside from the sex is your wife loving and supportive what are the other ways in which you feel loved does your wife talk to you does she communicate her needs and desires does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex if your wife is generally a loving open partner you use this to see that her behaviours arent personal whether she resolves this or not it can help you to cope with the rejection this is your wifes issue and the ball is in her courtin my opinion if couples therapy hasnt helped its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship if you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out it can help you manage your own emotions pressure to have sex might push her further away did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship one good way to make sure you get is to give and i mean give what she wants not sex its appropriate to say to her now i cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy i need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually if this is all you want im not sure i can do it if you want us to be more sexual i need you to address what gets in the way for you give her some time help her in any way you can and then see where you are see if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers thenyou have a decision to make i encourage you to make it looking at the big picture not just the sex
i have been dating a guy for two years i think i love him but i dont know any more i am in my late teens and i have been living with him for most of our relationship i have been talking to a guy friend and i feel more loved by him than my boyfriend hi michigan relationships are so sparkly for a few years and then things start to feel different most of the time this is simply because weve pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning we stop talking a lot because we have less to discoverwe do less for each other and buy fewer giftsspend less time togetherall because we have already formed the love and attachment and we dont need to fill the gas tank as much so just because it feels different doesnt mean its gone badhaving said that it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need you dont feel loved enough right now can you tell him have you told him the strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are let him know what you need and see if he gets it you have choices to make and there is no wrong choice you certainly have the right to say this isnt feeling great anymore or i want to explore other relationships and walk away but often its worth it to see how good something can be before you bail youre drawn to someone else and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new your boyfriend cant compete with that if he doesnt know youre unhappy for some people being drawn to someone else is a sign theyre not into their partner for others its a danger alert and it makes them want to improve their current relationship which one are you
he owns his own business sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me we have a son together and i get to stay home with him he says i complain too much about what hes doing weve been together a year and a half i got pregnant after being together for a month we moved in together when i had my son in july everything was great and then he started the staying out he then started not spending time with either of us i just dont know if im doing something wrong weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before congrats on the birth of your sonyour situation sounds painful lonely and isolatingand these features are eating away at your selfconfidencestart by believing in yourself the feelings and ideas you describe here would only be arising from within you because they are at the very least partly trueask your boyfriend if he is willing to listen and understand your point of view if he does then hopefully the two of you will more easily talk with one another about the truth of feeling overwhelmed by the quick pace of your courtship and becoming a familyif these discussions continuously include him blaming you for having your own feelings and expecting him to more actively be a part of your and your sons life then youll need to start valuing your feelings and what is best for you and your son by yourselfi send you lots of good luck
he owns his own business sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me we have a son together and i get to stay home with him he says i complain too much about what hes doing weve been together a year and a half i got pregnant after being together for a month we moved in together when i had my son in july everything was great and then he started the staying out he then started not spending time with either of us i just dont know if im doing something wrong weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before hi oklahoma listen to him when he says this is how he is your boyfriends behaviours are about him not you at the start of a relationship its easy to be loving and attentive but it takes years to really get to know someone deeply with time people reveal who they arefor some reason he is giving himself permission to detach from you and your son this could be for several reasons he may be avoiding intimacy and connection he may be avoiding commitment he may fear he isnt enough or and there is evidence of this one he may have misogynist attitudes about male privilege that interfere with his ability to be the kind of supportive and respectful partner that you need it seems that youve addressed this problem with him and told him what you need good for you his response seems dismissive though and this isnt a good sign any problem can be worked through if you have two people who care about respect and listen to each other it seems this basic foundation is missing herei suggest a therapist might be able to help you sort out where to go from here i wish you the best 
i love him so much and i dont know what to do does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you dont love himask him this so you will clearly know his definition of love
i love him so much and i dont know what to do hi savannah this is a pretty common issue one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving yet their partner doesnt feel loved theres a great book the five love languages by gary chapman he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we dont necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner you might feel that by going out to work and earn money youre being loving but if your partners main love language is quality time youre not hitting that bulls eye because youre not home the five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch i recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partners language a bit better you may never be fluent but you can get better the most important part is to understand each other better and to know that theres nothing wrong with either of you youre just speaking different languages you can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved i bet he just needs you to speak his language 
my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore hello it doesnt feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you especially if your feelings have not changed it can be scary frustrating and lonely have you tried talking to him about your concerns i would suggest to start there there may be several reasons for his actions some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and depending on his response may cause some relief when initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive there are a few things that you want to remember tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong avoid using extreme black and white language ie always and never for example you may say something such as i feel confused that we are rarely intimate and im wondering if youve also noticed this change versus you are never intimate with me anymore dont be afraid to ask him questions you deserve to know what is going on as his behavior is effecting your well being i like to ask openended questions instead of yes and no questions it allows for more clarity and deeper explanation lastly ask yourself and possibly him what part you play in the recent changes does he feel that youve been distant does he need something from you let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team if communication attempts fail seeing a couples therapist can be a great benefit having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationshipbest of luck to you
my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore your situation sounds a little painfulhave you brought up any of these topics for discussion with your fiancénow is a good time for finding out if and how your future husband is interested and addresses the way you are feelinguntil the two of you open up what bothers you all you or anyone who talks to you about the situation can do is take guesses as to what is driving your finances behaviorsalso in the moment of when your fiancé texts you words you find surprising or startling you can tell him this maybe by being clear and truthful about how what he writes affects you then next time he will change what he tells youand if he doesnt then you know that you explained yourself he had this information about you and that  he isnt that willing to consider what you told him really the best first step is to open up all the topics you wrote about here with him this way youll give each of you to discuss how to care about one another in a meaningful way
my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore hi rockford while no relationship is perfect and its natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we dont have to smother each other with attention anymore your situation sounds like something different he has no time for me yet you dont fight hmmmis it that you dont fight because you dont bring up whats bothering you are you avoiding conflict many people do what do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away as an engaged couple now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real or maybe you have spoken to him about it if so what happens does he listen and help you understand him better or does he avoid and reassure youor maybe dismiss you this is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together he says leave me alone thats a pretty bold statement about what he wants he doesnt seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is and how close you want to be plus i have to say those words sound more like what a closedoff fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be giving him the benefit of the doubt it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change but if this is true he needs to tell you that so you can understand so i suggest that the fact that when youre together youre okay is perhaps not the best barometer for how youre doing as a couple listen to your gut i encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are this may get rockier before it gets better but until you face whats not working you wont know who you truly are as a couple when youre engaged its a really cool time to see a therapist tooto get some conflict resolution skills down before youre a married couple
my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work i dont know how to trust him now but i really want to make it work and it seems like he does too but my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems hi michiganthis is a common issue how do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you i totally get that its hard and i believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone you can be stronger in the scarred places i would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust it is definitely possible to rebuild it because anything is possible if both people want it enoughyour boyfriend came clean to youthis is pretty crucial he chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret you can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file work on that filethicken it up having a thick he does care about me and wouldnt hurt me again file will help you other things that he can do to help you thicken that file because after all his behaviours caused this problem answer all your questions dont brush you off if youre feeling insecure treat you as though youre a priority avoid questionable contact with other women have open communication give you passwords to devices so there is transparency he can help you to understand where those behaviours came fromwhy he cheated in the first places although people arent always good with those why questionsyou can focus on telling yourself that people change that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal or at least youve decided to give him that chance and that you want to be a trusting person if you act like a trusting person you will likely feel more like one dont go snooping dont interrogate him its normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scaredthis is a start for you a good therapist can be helpful too
although we all want or wish that our partner is also our best friend in reality this doesnt always happen there may be issues of course and there are many things to consider there such as why do we need another person to confide in or are we actually attracted to this best friend but because we know we cant have them we put this thought behind etc etc is this friend and old friend an old flame or a new acquired friend the latter is complicated and probably the most questionable in my view so many things to think about and there is no one answer fits all
im in love with my friend who is also a girl i fell in love with her in a few months that was my first love we used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on facebook i thought she had the same feelings for me but i was wrong i always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life but all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy ive tried to be in relationship with guys but i cant be in love with them it all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is you may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real this is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person time will tell but if you need to discuss this you could see your school councelor if you are at schooluniversity or find a lgbt group with meetings and discuss this with them i hope this is helpful
ive been getting told lately by my partner that its embarrassing that im so antisocial around his family and friends i believe its because im not as social as him hi buffalo i think youre right your partners reactions are about him i have to say its a cruel thing to say to someone you lovethat youre embarrassed by them the subtext says youre not good enough and i love that you can reject that false messageyou dont have to be different for anyone if he cant accept you for who you are what is he doing with you your social habits unless they are extremelike you refuse to go anywhere arent a reflection on him its just you being you also and im sure youve found thisthe more he judges you the more difficult it is for you to be the confident outgoing person he wants you to beso his method of trying to change you doesnt even worki think thats the cruxhes trying to change you what does that make you want to do
how can i know if im just being paranoid hi texasoh thats a powerful idea isnt it it burrows into your head lets figure this out first has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them have they cheated before if not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence if its a yes then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that youre hiding something i need openness if they havent cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on what is the specific thing thats triggering your fears when you have your data recorded read onthe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fearpeople cheat for their own reasons not because were not interesting this may be true if what you wrote down is they didnt really do anything wrongthere is no evidence im just scared and suspicious thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened i can trustif what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or youre having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions trust your gut but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheatingits evidence of something ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptionsthe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you i hope that helps
my partner and i have had an amazing relationship and connection for over two years were very committed to each other and are planning a very long life together however he recently was very open and honest that he isnt interested in having sex with me anymore he says this has happened in every past relationships and has ended it as a result he knows its because its the same person feeling but how can he get over this i wonder how long anymore will be for your boyfriendsince you both are planning a long life together instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committedwhat are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationshipknowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like
we got into arguments and we would break if off but start it back up again we clicked or so i thought we are both married with problems in our marriage we never have sex we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together his wife found out and he lied to her and didnt even refer to it as an affair i cant stop thinking about him we just click ive been married for 16 years and ive never liked anyone other than my husband now i like him and well never be together if you will never be together and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved there is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible then maybe you want something else for your life if you and your husband are willing i would encourage you to do some therapy or counselling together you may enjoy this article to learn a little more about some factors that lead to connection or disconnection and that predict separation and divorce
my boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me and i believe it it has been one of the best relationships i have been in for a short period of time but he has lied to me so much hell tell me that hell stop lying and while hes saying that hes hiding something or lying about something first it was about a girl he hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in next was his exgirlfriend he put a fake contact name and it was just friendly but he lied to my face all the time he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better new york new yorkits not your boyfriends lying that concerns me the most its the lies you tell yourself verbal expressions are easy but its walking the walk thats more important in the end when someone shows you what theyre capable of you can believe them hes capable of being manipulative and deceitful and he even lies as hes telling you hell stop lying what youre doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence he might love you with his heart but love in the end is a verb and is based on respectful loving behaviours my wish is that you start by believing in what you deserve
i was texting a guy who wasnt my boyfriend and my boyfriend found out we work together so he went to work and told everyone i was cheating on him i moved out of the house there have been previous problems and i feel like im usually the issue here in order for us to move on he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesnt want me to do anymore im wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if i should walk away hi dallas while i think its healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds onesided and rigid will you have a list too there are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forwarddoes he decide when you move in and out your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you dont have a voice in this relationship do you have a voice if you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice if you cant hear your own voice maybe its time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and wantno relationship is all good or all bad wouldnt that make it easy relationships dont come with billboards that tell us what to do they dont come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor you have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you youre too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly a therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is
about a month ago i went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his exgirlfriend that he was dating before me he gave her a promise ring when they were together and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room i found many things on his phone but that broke my heart the most he deleted all the messages but two i cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that it really kills me and i cant stop thinking about it your sense of hurt is very understandabledo you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phonesi ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationshipprobably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the otherwith this new level of clarity his past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little
i have been married for 20 years he and i both cheated i hid my cheating for 14 years over that time i let life stress me out i became depressed when i finally woke up he felt i had pushed him out do you both want to fix the marriagethe relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too will have one person who does all the changingthis dynamic itself creates problems of its ownabout your husband telling you he feels pushed out did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like thisall you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt likeif he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you is okbecause affairs create mistrust between two people the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each others trusttalking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other how you each are feeling what matters to you is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriages future
my boyfriend recently got a kitty i hate cats in general and he knows it it grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat i want to throw out the cat i feel very jealous sorry for you and sorry for the cat because youre each in a tense positionwhat was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with youif you dont already know his answer then find out doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you does he expect you to accept without question whatever he does does he care about your views does a cat have some deep meaning for him that having one is essential to his life and he never told you soplease dont be mean to the cat its not the cats fault for being in your boyfriends carethere are plenty of other cats on this earth so throwing out the cat will not solve anything between you and your boyfriendwho knows your boyfriend may come back home with three more catsstart with a conversation about your feelings and his interest in your feelings
over the course of a few days my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues after she thought things through she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me she instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family at that point she said our marriage was over now over the course of the last few days she has taken a friendship from a coworker she insists there is nothing more than friends but she has spent all her free time with him hi portlandthis must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend i get how upsetting this isif i was your therapist id want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening be careful not to jump to conclusions sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage she may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said so its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisisshes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist but its not your place to tell her to do this or its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her right now its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate if shes asking for that we cant trap people in a marriage if she needs separation or distance then its respectful to give her thatthat doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now i would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what you want whether its to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of time i cant predict what will happen here but you can find out what the best path for you is i wish you the best

i have no idea what happened i go places and do things but still feel lonely i honestly have no friends and i am always the one texting people and bothering people i feel invisible like someone that no one wants to be around a lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situationsis it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your lifeif yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choiceat the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you firstalso most relationships are not forever is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity
i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration i hate it i dont know why but i just want it to be over i feel like crying i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it although i am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area an initial question i have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing if you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over i would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time until you figure out what is going on i encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations if any about being sexually active do you fear pregnancy are there problems in the relationship are you afraid of the emotional intimacy another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way when these types of traumatic events occur people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with if this is the case i strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues a final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration if so i would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems although pain can also be associated with emotional issues it is always good to rule out possible physical causes i hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction take care
i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration i hate it i dont know why but i just want it to be over i feel like crying i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it does your boyfriend notice that you hate sexif yes then it is a topic which the two of you would gain deeper understanding of each other by discussingif no then possibly one reason for hating sex is that your boyfriend doesnt notice who you are as a person not simply a physical body engaged in sex
i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust hello being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her if so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back couples counseling would be of benefit if not then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from there are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them the issue is not likely to get resolved in the meantime i suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship hope it all works out for you both
i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust instead of fighting about trust is it possible for you and your wife to talk with other about areas which upset each of youwhenever feelings are hurt knowing what exactly is problematic and being heard and understood by the partner goes a long way to building trustthese type of discussions are hard to have and especially for the first time a lot of emotions arise and often people lose their conversation focus from thisif you and your wife have a tough time opening up to each other consider scheduling time with a couples therapistjust by each of you committing time to invest in the relationship will show faith in the relationship and this may contribute to restoring trust
ive been in a relationship for over a year hes cheated and lied i heard hes married but he says hes not everything is very up and down theres no trust recently he went on a trip and i promised him id behave and not drink because when i drink i drink too much and i tend to make poor choices this time i made a huge mistake i drank too much and i cheated on him i slept with another man for about five minutes before realizing what i was doing is wrong i told him and he just got really rude he called me names and threatened me i feel bad as i do love him we just have so many issues im not a bad person ive just made a lot of bad mistakes its unintentional and i know right from wrong but why do i still make the wrong choice hi calgary canada let me get this straightyoure in a relationship but he might be married you both cheat and lie and hes abusive the short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it relationships dont heal us and they dont help us grow up we have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before its going to work id recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while you have a lot to sort out i wish you the best
i crave attention companionship and sex she has had a hysterectomy and she has a bad knee hi hamptonalthough id bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now i also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you this is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs if you both want the relationship to improve a couples therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea its a complex picture that youve only given us a glimpse ofin the meantime you can try a few things have compassion for your wife shes in pain and this may preoccupy her sex may be uncomfortable for her she needs understanding you need understanding too right help her to see that youre not just angry but lonely and hurt it might affect how you see yourself as a man showing her irritability or anger might push her farther awaythere are many ways to be close intimate and sexual that dont involve intercourse you might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you wont pressure her to have intercourse find out what your wifes wishes and ideas are you might be surprisedthese things take time to address especially if theyve been years in the making i do recommend seeing that therapist relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change best of luck
ive been with my husband for eight years now we have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated i took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes however we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust my insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again during that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child
the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life
im of course hurt and in shock i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go my heart will still be torn apart i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought hi jayuya im struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cant do that and i dont think either of those things will help you id like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe do you have supports do your family and friends know whats happening in your life have you ever been to a womens shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly thats what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best
i just got married with my husband i have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past i know all marriages have problems but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust its hard for me to let go because i love him but i am getting tired hi louisianayou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshiptrust is the first stage in a relationship moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element but you didnt see this coming did you thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface i give you credit for wanting it to work and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust good luck
my boyfriend and i have not had sex in a couple of weeks he had to have a cyst removed on his testicles i have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him im scared to touch him and get close to him because im afraid that i will hurt him are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex againbeing able to talk together about topics that involve both of you will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional levelalso there are many ways of making love if your bfs cyst hasnt yet healed then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions is to read about these together with himi hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another while developing more emotional closeness in the process
my husband always works he does work from home but his hours are from morning until night and he neglects his family if i have anything i want to do i have to find a babysitter but he does what he wants he rarely comes to bed when i do and we never have date nights hi ohio the crazy things about situations like this is that almost guaranteed while your husband is out working and away from home he feels hes doing it all for you and the kids he believes hes loving you he might feel like hes carrying his family on his shoulders your love language is differentyoud rather spend time with him or talk to himyou want to feel like hes a bigger part of the family and feel connected to him i absolutely understand that and i support you asking for thathe might very well miss that feeling of connectedness too but hes likely also feeling the weight of financial responsibility a lot of men and women dont talk about this but they feel it sometimes they feel like they cant win either way theres pressure to earn and pressure to be home he has needs too he probably wants more appreciation and less blame i urge you to talk to him about how you feel find out how hes feeling and use a professional to assist you if your communication styles arent great right now you want to spend time with him and that tells me that you have a good chance of addressing this problem successfully
my husband always works he does work from home but his hours are from morning until night and he neglects his family if i have anything i want to do i have to find a babysitter but he does what he wants he rarely comes to bed when i do and we never have date nights im glad youre aware to expect more satisfaction from being part of a couple than you currently describe yourself as havingare you and your husband able to talk about any or all of what youve written herehis answers would be a starting point for knowing how he understands his share of your relationship and whether and how he would like making any changesif the two of you feel too much tension in the relationship to bring up any of the topics you write about here then ask yourself the reason for thisvery commonly people are afraid to ask questions of their partner even when feeling unhappy and that theyd like changes to the relationshipoften people are fearful of harsh criticism by the partner and worry that by simply stating the reasons for feeling unhappy will mean hearing judgments against them spoken by the partnerit is always a good idea to utilize the services of a professional credentialed and licensed therapist if after trying to start a conversation on the topics you bring up here does not go well or very farfor all of us the emotions in our intimate relationships are deep and powerful they are not easy to handle especially under tension and frustrationsending lots of good wishes for future happiness
how do i stop those thoughts the thoughts you are having are just thoughts not actions it is your choice whether you act on these thoughts if you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great if you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts you may want to see a cognitivebehavioural therapist take care
talking to your partner about whats off would be a good place to start but sometimes that can be really hard to muster the courage to do alone it may not feel emotionally safe to dive into this is where couples and even more specifically sex therapy can be really helpful therapy with a qualified professional can help to hold a safe and supportive space for you and your partner to open and explore these dynamics you can also pick up some amazing books like passionate marriage which could be what you need to get that conversation started
depends what do would you like to see happen
im a 40 year old male and having erection problems still have the desire for a woman awfully frustrated any suggestions my doc doesnt want to discuss it when a doc blows you off it may be a signal that it is time to find a new one ed can often be caused by health issues if all physical possibilities are ruled out then its time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist heres a good article for you to start with
im a 40 year old male and having erection problems still have the desire for a woman awfully frustrated any suggestions my doc doesnt want to discuss it hi there first off i have to commend you for reaching out it takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems believe it or not this problem is very common for men and women there are some things that you can try naturally before resulting in medication such as your eating habits and exercise i would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly how much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily these are just a few common things to look at you would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies our bodies are like a car you have to maintenance it in order for it to continue to run if you would like to get further natural advice andor suggestions on eating healthy and exercising i would recommend you see a nutritionist a nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet as far as your doctor i would recommend looking into getting another doctor i have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything that appears to be a personal issue on their part i hope i was helpful and i wish you the best of luck
my wife and i are newly married about 2 months weve had some issues surrounding sex particularly her lack of libido shes on an anxiety medication of which diminished libido is a side effect but i think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacyromance centered around my hectic schedule our sex life has suffered as a result tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex which is a big deal once things started she had the most obviously fake orgasm ive ever encountered i was honest with her about why and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it she responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking i dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation i think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further please help you are newly married you have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication what if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another you know like the gestures you each likely made while dating it turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments and have fun with it
we make love once per month is it normal to begin with whats normal for one couple isnt going to be normal for the next every couple has their own normal and thats important to keep in mind your sexual lives will ebb and flow what id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having id also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it here
when having sex i think of other men and want other men all day long been married 3 years together 14 what do you think sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be it sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together thats both common and confusing intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow resparking your passion will involve growing using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs security and wants desires marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required
i have this weird fetish that im afraid to open up about it what should i do this is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is i do understand that this is something that is bothering you though the first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not if this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urgeshowever if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings you may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of you may find other people have the same interest as you find a therapist that you can trust and tell them dont hold back with your therapist trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are there is no need to suffer with this alone
my boyfriend cant get over my promiscuous past he says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction he says he should have had more sex with different people i dont know how to handle this i am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history for one thing it is a good idea to be checked for stds before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do this gets into a gray area for some people i dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and i certainly dont want a whole lot of details sometimes that is an image i just dont want in my head about my partner vague details are usually enoughhowever i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past this is a reflection on him not you this shows insecurities on his part you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship you can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you i have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity it takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though if your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment i dont see that you have done anything wrong if you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you it is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be in time the right person for you will enter your life
i have no sex drive due to medical issues ive shut down completely and closed everyone out ive even told my husband that i wanted a divorce since thats what i thought he wanted to hear however it devastated me when i learned hes seeing someone else
ive since told him that i wanted to work things out but hes not sure i actually mean it he thinks the only reason i want him back is because im jealous how do i show him im serious im sorry to hear about your current situation my heart goes out to you during this timefirst of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing more than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptomssecondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling i think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being himif you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship the conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial and please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof was not your faultbest of luck to you and your husband
