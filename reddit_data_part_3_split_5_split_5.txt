well f to m but its not relevant to the post anyway just put it in because my last one got immediately taken down

i was prescribed testosterone about 6 weeks ago my doctor told me to have lab work done in 34 months and follow up with him he gave me a piece of paper that has all the blood tests i need on it but it doesnt seem like its a prescription it doesnt even have his name on it
""
now if i didnt have to move back home from college two states away this probably wouldnt have been an issue because the clinic i went through has a lab but that cliniccompany doesnt exist in this state so now im just super confused about what to do can i go to a lab here not affiliated with that company and have it sent to my doctor do i have to find a whole new doctor i didnt findthis doctor myself and have no idea how to go about finding someone that would prescribe me testosterone and who knows what theyre doing

any advice or direction would be very helpful thanks in advance

okay so ive been having some weird aching going on in my inner thigh on my left leg its actually almost the back of my thigh really if i put my leg out straight and the top were 12 on a clock the pain is at around 45 o clock starts about 2 inches down the leg from basically the area in between my nutsack and left buttcheekmaybe a little more towards the buttcheek and it goes from there down to about 45 inches above my left inner knee but still more towards the back far as i can tell from my anatomy app id say its the semimembranosus muscle pretty much the entire length of that the pain is more a deep ache mostly when i walk or stand up also hurts when applying pressure with my hands
""
obviously that probably sounds like a muscle strain of some kind affecting that particular muscle but its odd to me because its fairly random some days it doesnt hurt in the slightest other days its worse it tends to also pop up after ive been sitting for some time and like i said it hurts when i walk also the whole 2 month thing is kind of weird to me ive pulled plenty of muscles in my life and it seems like they usually healed faster than that also the randomness of it far as i can recall pulled muscles pretty much hurt the whole time you have them so anyway im just curious if theres anything i should be concerned about i know theres some more serious stuff that can cause inner thigh pain like that
hey guys ive become slightly worried  anxious about my health because of my vision i am a 19 year old male who started playing football at age 8 or 9 and this is when i recall my double vision first starting in my elementary through high school years i have had multiple concussionsafter this happened i went to an eye doctor who prescribed me glasses and told me how my right eye is perfect and my left eye is bad for my age  and it has kept decreasing in heath since but even with these glasses which do help me i have trouble seeing and i worry it will effect my driving because looking long distance or even placing my head in certain spots like when i am lying down and watching tv i cant do it with out double vision i either close one eye put the glasses on but this doesnt help me if i tilt my head back because i get double vision again or i have to prop my head up against a pillow and sit up right or in a chair i dont have any serious migraines but i do get them but i also live in the hot state of arizona as well id go to a doctor but we all know we are in a weird situation right now and i dont have insurance as of a week or so ago hopefully approved soon but anyways any help would be appreciated thanks god bless

im a 14 year old white female who is 52 and 135 lbs i dont have any diagnosed medical conditions as long as i can remember ive gotten random aches in my legs and i remember it always happening when i was sleepy it was never stabbing pain and just a ache that was easy to ignore i thought it was normal and that was a sign from your body that you should sleep it always went away in the morning
""
now as the years have gone past i realized that it was not normal and has evolved i dont know how much of this is connected but ill try to put everything i can here just in case
""
in 6th grade my crotch was constantly itchy at the time i was an idiot and used a bunch of toilet paper for my periods so i didnt have to change pads so i thought it was the toilet paper that caused it i stopped using toilet paper and changed my pads regularly after that but i kept having some random itchiness scattered through my middle school years i dont know if this is any relation but it might be
""
im now in 8th grade and the pain seems to have evolved i think the first time the pain was in my arm was when i had a weird reaction to something that bit me i think it was a horsefly but ive never had a reaction like i did ever before to a horsefly bite my eyes were glossy my cheeks had a kind of painful redness on them and my arm was so itchy when i applied a homemade oil remedy on it it stopped the itch but it was an ache like the ones im experiencing now after a few days it went away now i feel that ache typically at night or when im resting in my arms and my legs it travels like its in my leg one time and in my arm later ive also noticed my body will randomly feel weaker like i cant support something i could easily support an hour ago the worst is the chest pains im guessing this is what heartburn feels like but sometimes the my chest hurts and it isnt the ache like the rest of my body but its a pain that sometimes stabs me if i move wrong my sleep is also so messed up i could easily sleep 12 hours or more and instantly fall asleep if im in a car even a strangers car ill have these random
days where ill have to pee very often for no reason i have to pee right now for the 3rd time in 4 hours my periods which were usually consisted have gone haywire although that might be from stress my ears always seem to have something akin to pimples on them theyre bumps that never seem to go away since 6th grade they appear anywhere on my ear my elbows were just extremely itchy and now are dry and cracking but its going away now
""
im so confused im definitely not a health nut but im pretty sure people have a worse diet and dont experience this i cut off soda and quite a bit of my normal junk food i eat for awhile but the pains seemed to get worse i participate in all my schools gym exercises to the best of my ability and i do yoga weekly and its still a problem my dad has wanted to take me to a doctor for quite a bit due to the excessive sleeping but now were avoiding all medical care centers of its not a dire emergency
""
so my final question is what the heck is going on and what can i do at home to try to help it

im zane and im a twenty year old male im 6 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds give or take i never smoked and i do not take any medication

so a year ago i hurt my ankle bad and twisted it im not sure how bad though it was though it took a month maybe for me to walk comfortably again it looks like its always bruised now like permanently brown i didnt go to a hospital which i now know was a stupid mistake my parents hate hospitals so i just didnt even consider it my ankle feels fine though i think its stiffer now and a little less movable i know nothing can really be done now i guess i just want to know if i went to a hospital from the moment it happened would my ankle look and feel better

as the title says i have virtually zero emotions and havent for some time now i used to be super emotional and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety i was put on antidepressants and went through therapy but since ive been on antidepressants i feel totally apathetic towards everything i dont feel miserable anymore but instead i dont feel anything i dont enjoy any of my old hobbies and i dont feel empathy towards people like i used to and i used to be really empathetic i feel like every day im just completing a checklist of tasks which im completely indifferent to i cant even cry anymore and all of my interactions with people feel forced and like im just pretending
""
the obvious answer would be that its my tablets causing this but even when i dont take them i still feel the same way i definitely dont want to go back to how i was before i was put on antidepressants because feeling nothing is easier to live with than wanting to cry all the time but it would be nice to have a bit of feeling back because honestly its tiring having to act like i feel something all the time when i just dont any ideas as to what this is and if theres anything i can do about it or is this just how i am now

for some brief background my husband has been experiencing lowgrade fevers headache and mild cough for almost a week now out of caution  he works in a hospital  he made a telehealth appointment and was called in to be tested for strepflucovid today the first two were negative and hell learn the remaining result on wednesday but were acting as if he has it until we know otherwise

i began to experience a sore throat tight chest and onandoff mild fevers 99100 on thursday of last week and have developed a painful dry cough as of today i figure im sick with whatever my husband is sick with whether its covid or something else

questions
""
1 if my husband tests positive is there any practical reason for me to get tested it makes no difference to my employment situation and id as soon not burden the system or expose the testers needlessly unless i actually require medical help
""
2 is there any point in trying to keep space between family members in our small one bathroom home we have a 5yearold and a 6yearold who have thus far been healthy distancing seems impossible but we honestly havent even tried were both low on energy right now and have been taking turns engaging the children keeping them fed etc not sure what else to do

some quick back story i am a 23 year old female roughly 5 foot 7 and around 145 lbs giving that info cause i know sometimes joint pain could be weight or age related ever since i was around 11 or 12 i have had random pain in my knees with my hips eventually jointing them in the pain parade
i have had rounds of physical therapy 6 times in my life to try and combat the issue but it doesnt really offer very worth while results i was instructed for a while at around 14 to wear two j hook knee braces on each leg to help not really sure what that did i remember the first doctor i saw at that time believe he was an orthopedic but not sure told me i would most likely grow out of it but i dont really know what it is my pain is a deep and dull ache deep in my joints that seemingly has no real triggers i generally either just sit through the pain or if its bad enough i will take ibuprofen and lay down my joints will of course hurt and tire out a bit faster than my peers and things like stairs will cause sharp pain down the fronts of my knees sometimes but otherwise sometimes the pain just happens while im sitting down or going to bed with no real physical trigger it seems
i have been to orthopedic doctors many times and been given cortisone shots as remedies before but its of course only temporary and i still dont really know why this happens to me
does anyone have any pointers or things to help me better ask my orthopedic doctor questions should i go back to see him again last time i saw him was roughly two years ago i think
ive been told i can come back whenever i feel i need to assess my pain again but ive grown a little tired of the cycle the pain was a good bit worse when i was younger but as remained consistent for roughly the past 6 or 7 years
""
notes i was tested for arthritis when i was around 16 by my gp at the time and that test came back negative also i do a lot of the exercises i was taught at physical therapy at home on a regular basis which for help a little

i recently was masturbating and had brown semen it hurt the first time i peed after the brown semen which was about 5 minutes after ejaculation i did not look at my urine out of fear of discoloration i peed this morning and continue to pee fine with no pain i have not masturbated since the incident

hello im writing in hopes i could get some advice on my situation ive been in for a while now
""
ive been having an itchy vulva for around a month now that is sometimes constant and other times barely noticeable ive been prescribed hydrocortisone creams and that didnt help stop the itch overtime ive been noticing tears cuts that would sting when i wipe or wash that area and they would heal and new ones would form overtime they slowly all went away however today i did itch down there and without realising it created a massive gash like tear by my clit that bled quite a lot never seen or experienced anything like it its gotten to the point where im scared to wipe incase i tear more skin or itch or do anything down there and sex is out of the picture for quite a while now so im getting extremely concerned with how delicate my vulva area is and just needing some advice as to why just an itch can cause a massive open gash to form and why and how my skin has gotten like this and what can i do moving forward there is more to this situation with regards to irregualr periods and coming on and off the contraceptive pill but i wanted to keep it fairly short but am happy to explain in more detail if needed

i had bloodwork done testing iron levels my thyroid pregnancy anything that could affect my period and it all came back normal i attributed it to covid19 stress
my period was due this month on saturday and it has not yet come its typically accurate down to the day due to my birth control i am starting to get really worried as im not sure whats up with my body i have no other unusual symptoms no nausea sorenesstenderness headaches etc so i have no idea what else to look for the doctor seemed unconcerned but this isnt typical for me

hey im currently a 19 year old female college student and ive had pretty bad anxiety for a long timeim 57 and about 155 lbs with no medications or health problems since i have to have that in here ive never been to a doctor and the thought of it stresses me out my mom asked her personal doctor about it and he told her that i dont need any sort of medication unless it starts to hinder me from doing things
""
i think i suffered a lot this first year of college due to my anxiety i didnt go to professors office hours i rarely went to the gym and when i did my heart rate was incredibly high before i got there because i was so nervous i went to few student org meetings and i even stopped going to one really cool club because they were forcing us to do activities that required human interaction
""
i get so much anxiety from asking anyone questions and i dont speed in class unless im called on i hate asking for help because it makes me anxious i have trouble performing tasks when people are watching me even if its something as simple as tying my shoes or washing dishes i think it has affected my grades as well as my wellbeing until recently i hadnt really ever considered medication but when i realized how great of a connection i missed out on with one of my professors i broke down i decided i cant go these next three years like this
""
basically i just need some recommendations ive heard from some people that they have found counseling to be super helpful but i have also heard that its more expensive and my family doesnt really have the extra money for that does anyone have experience with the same sort of anxiety im experiencing and how did you deal with it anything helps

my blood pressure tonight was 10567 i wanted to ask if this has brought it down too much i havent taken my nightly dosage just yet i havent felt lightheaded or faint at all which i know is commonly associated with low bp and i know ive not reached that range yet but given ive only been on the drug for about a month i wasnt sure if this change was too drastic or not i may just be surprised to see such a change in my numbers and this is a good thing but my doc and i hadnt discussed what a good goal would look like thank you for your help

im trying to solve a problem ive had for a while about two years ago i was at a movie theater and i got a sharp pain in my eye it could have been after i rubbed my eye with something in it i dont remember what was happening leading up to the pain but it was like a small sharp sting it wasnt super painful just annoying and unusual the next day my eyelid was swollen so i did a cold compress and called an optometrist i got an appointment for a few days later and by the time i saw him the swelling had gone down and i was feeling back to normal he checked me out but said everything looked fine
""
a while after that a few months maybe i noticed a little bump i could feel on my eye with my finger when i touched my eyelid it didnt hurt and my vision wasnt changed so i kind of thought it must be scar tissue or something from when my eye hurt assuming i had scratched my cornea or something not sure if this is what really happened but its my best uneducated guess i decided to wait and mention it at my next eye checkup
""
so at my next eye doc appointment i mentioned the bump at the end of the checkup the doc said yeah i noticed you might have a little debris or something in your eye and he gave me some artificial tears to help wash it out it didnt really help
""
the bump is still here and not painful or affecting my vision but it always low key feels like something is stuck in my eye especially if im up late or early and my eyes are kind of puffy is this something i should be more worried about my eye docs would have noticed if it were something serious like cancer or something that would cause me to go blind right

not too long ago i noticed a weird sort of pain near the pelvic area on the right side i would best describe it as a sort of numb and strainish kind of pain along with inconsistent bowels ranging from mostly liquid solid but has empty holes two different shades of brown on the poop or solid poop but looks sort of mushy sometimes when i start coughing it would lead into regurgitation regardless if i ate or not also to note that the pain is usually not always there as it shows up shortly after i wake up disappears for a few hours and come back at some point in the afternoon or i wake up with no pain and it will come around a few hours after i wake up disappear for some of the day and then come back
this isnt the first time as it has happened to me about a year and a half ago and i did see the doctor about it a few times the doctor diagnosed me with gastritis and gave me omeprazole dicyclomine berroca plus and suggested probiotics but none of them seem to work eating healthy like veggies and lean meats didnt seem to help it either even eating stuff like hot cheetos or soda seem to have no affect to my stomach im not 100 sure but exercising also seemed to make the problem worse which is why im not exercising right now
""
side note i once woke up in the middle of the night needing to poop but held it back and i heard heavy stomach rumbles after that and im not sure if that contributed to the inconsistent bowels

after about three days my hands began to swell up really badly my right worse than my left and they stopped using the iv in my right hand on day five when they tried to draw blood from my elbow it didnt work and the phlebotomist had to use my leg the iv stopped working in my left hand soon after and they put a picc line in my left arm and were no longer able to draw blood the entire thing wasnt really a concern for any of the staff and it wasnt discussed again i was in twice daily pt for 4 months and the staff kinda went wow thats not good but no more concern
""
the swelling in my hands was so bad i could barely use crutches and only really began to go down after a month in december when i had the skin graft they could barely get an needle in my left arm and were reluctant to use my hadnt because of bruising they eventually had to use my wrist with an infant butterfly needle and the bruising from the failed attempt at drawing blood only disappeared in january
""
i dont normally bruise easily and they tested for iron deficiency for another reason and it was fine the pain isnt awful and comes and goes but the fact its still here after so long makes me nervous the bruising isnt that visible but is certainly noticeable when i point it out to people particularly on my right hand if i sleep on my side or even lightly lean on my right hand i get pain in my fingers and my hand goes cold and numb and after get pins and needles
""
i had the surgeries in another country to where i live so cant see my old surgery team about it and am reluctant to see a gp here frankly because im scared and dont want them touching it because of pain if there was treatment needing done too surely it would mean sticking something else in but then i started to get worried i could have real long lasting damage and got nervous
""
tldr i had a knee replacement in september dual ivs with strong stuff in them both veins blew and nearly 8 months later theres still bruising and theyre painful worried i might lose a hand or something but no one in hospital thought it was worth looking into

i havent had my periods since 2016 because of birth control and being underweight but it has never been something my doctors have been worried about i had birth control implant put in last december and only had slight spotting first few days
""
i started to take iron supplements on my doctors recommendation two weeks ago because my iron levels have always been kinda low and only 3 days after i got my first real period it lasted for few days and was heavier than expected but no cramping or anything
""
however yesterday i noticed spotting but it was really brown and looked like completely dried blood when i wiped i noticed a long stringy thing on toilet paper it looked like a blood vessel and i shrugged it off however today the spotting continued and i got 3 of them and started to worry a bit they were translucent but filled with blood on some spots
""
they cant be any kind of worms right is it really normal to get these i know the description is quite vague but i have no idea how to google this phenomenon and im quite worried

im also wondering if i might have been missing my periods because of iron deficiency the levels have never been alarming so it hasnt really been considered but im curious since the period started right after starting the supplements

if it helps i was anemic a year ago but it shouldnt be an issue anymore as my diet has changed since then i do not take any type of drugs nor do i drink

they occasionally burn or get sore and theyve been there for about 3 weeks are they worth being concerned over or should i try ignoring them

in the past few months hes had jock itch 3 times it usually goes away on its own but his current rash has been there for almost 3 weeks it is bright red and bleeding in some spots probably from scratching it it has a very distinct border to it and is in the usual jock itch place the crease of his legs and testicles he could only get a skype doctor appointment because covid is very bad in our city and he got a prescription the same day he lost his health insurance and the prescription was almost 400 so we went with an over the counter ive bought every over the counter treatment i could find and nothing has helped my mom is a nurse and said i could give him a diflucan pill usually used for vaginal yi my doctor gives me refills for it my mom also gave him a medicated powder which has provided some relief but isnt treating it
i dont know if this has anything to do with it but we eat very healthy most of the time but hes been stressed and is drinking sprite and ginger ale and sugary crap with every meal im assuming it isnt great for fungal infections but i dont know we really arent sure what else to do if the diflucan doesnt work and im worried its going to get infected

i started doing excercise about 7 weeks ago after a two year break where i lived unhealthy with almost no movement and eating unhealthy
when cycling my right leg and right hand and atm started going numb after about 20 minutes beginning with the toes and fingers i also started having pain in my pelvic base which kept getting more uncomfortable when sitting down
i then started having problems with my erection where almost no blood would enter the penis or i couldnt control it
""
after about 3 weeks i suddenly kept getting really tired from time to time my hands and forehead would go cold or i would start sweating the slightes physical activity would make my pulse go racing 120 to 145 and sometimes i felt slight chest pain andvor dizzyness
i started waking up at night with a higher pulse and feeling my leg or hand go numb again while lying on my back
i started having problems concentrating with my memory reading it felt as if i had problems moving my eyes properly across the block of text writing and some friends told me that i started talking more slowly than usual
""
then two weeks ago my left leg started hurting and veins appeared stronger on the surface the following days my lower leg always became swollen when walking or standing for some time and i would start limping and have to lay down
the doctor made sure that the veins are open and there is no thrombose yet the pain keeps coming back
""
as of today i keep getting extremely tired my heartrate goes up to 140 just from going on a walk my leg keeps swelling and hurting after standingwalking for some time at night my legs or hands would start ticklinggoing numb and i would wake up because of it and have to move them sometimes my legs would start hurting even when lying down my head feels slightly clouded and i still habe problems reading writing with focus etc i am unable to get an erection my eyes are somewhat red in the morning which is something i didnt have before
""
my doctor said it might be a neurological problem
""
i keep thinking it might have something to do with my heartcirculationvesselsbrain or be a combination of both or of some underlying disease

i first noticed it about 3 days ago on the top of my right wrist it is noticeably red and very dry i thought it was eczema i had pretty bad eczema on my elbow pit from ages 912 but ive had zero symptoms since until now
""
it feels like a very mild burning sensation with the occasional itching i really only notice it when i think about it the skin is red and flaky it hurts more when i move my wrist
""
yesterday i noticed there is a very small patch on my left hand but it is very small like a circle 25 inches in diameter but the symptoms feel like the cover my left wrist as well as my lower left hand it also feels dryer than usual
""
but today it has broken out on my left lower eyelid my eye had been itching for a couple hours but not unbearable i kept rubbing it and it is possible i touched it with my wrist at some point it came up out of nowhere like within the span of a 2 hours it popped up it is also very mild about as much as the other patches
""
i have been applying triamcinolone acetonide cream on my wrist which i used to use on my eczema as a child i stopped using it tonight because i dont want to apply medicine on something i am unsure of
""
here are pictures of my left eye and right wrist rash pictures httpsimgurcomaxwnhebk

there have been some notable changes in my daily life and schedule due to the quarantine that could have caused contributed to the rash such as bathing less every other day as opposed to 12 times a day a fluctuating sleep schedule added stress more time at home less physical activity and frequent hand washing

i appreciate the help i cannot go to the doctors currently because i do not want to come in contact with the corona virus so i hope you guys can help me get some answers

i already have this purifier at my house and the filters are really easy for me to get and affordable
last week or so ive been getting these itchy red spots on my arms feet and side
theyve been causing me a lot of annoyance and would like to know if anyone can figure out what they are allergic reaction bites etc
my wife doesnt seem to get them our dog doesnt have fleas ive cleaned my office and bedroom and sprayed bedbug spray replaced the mattress and ordered smoke bombs if anyone knows exactly what these are i can either get the correct treatment for the house or confirm the ones im using thank you so much and stay safe lt3

""
as an example a couple days ago i was playing a video game my mom came over and told me to take my dog out i said ok hold on ill take him in a bit 30 seconds later she asks me again i get a bit more mad and say please hold on 1 minute later she says when are you taking him in a loud voice i say mom i told you im taking him just wait please she then starts petting the dog while telling him no he doesnt want to take you no no he doesnt at this point i want to fucking loose it i want to fucking break all my shit why the fuck can no one wait 10 fucking minutes
""
but at the same time why the fuck can i not pause my game and take my dog out like i can see it clearly after its a simple task but during the event i dont see that as an option the thought isnt in my head my gf just tells me to stop doing that and do it but the option is not fucking there she doesnt understand this she says i our excuses for everything but theres no fucking option my brain doesnt know it exists i dont know what this happens to me please help im sos close to breaking down
""

deleted
any observations or suggestions on my current situation is highly appreciated because i am unable to visit my doctor right now due to the situation  im 18m 59 175 pounds
""
a little bit of introduction ive always been a little anxiousover think things slightly hypochondriac but nothing extreme very mild and nothing that has effected my life significantly i thoroughly enjoy learning biologyanatomy so through out this i have done a plethora of self research which in a way made my anxiety worse at times assuming the worst scenarios i have plenty of support and am open to my parents about my situation and my girlfriend which i live with currently
""
about 8 months ago i went to my doctor with shortness of breath chest tightness and general anxiety at this time i was a heavy marijuana smoker i had been smoking for 68 months before this with no issues my anxiety was fueled by the symptoms i was experiencing and the weed definitely amplified my anxiety about them
""
the doctor has me buy a blood pressure machine and i check my bp twice daily while calm and after sitting as directed by doctor my numbers are consistently 14080 with systolic readings in the morning of 160 i get diagnosed with hypertension i have family history of hypertension and doctor believes this and anxiety to be the cause once i was diagnosed my anxiety was alleviated tremendously
""
ekg and echocardiogram are fine doctor puts me on 25mg lisniprolthis did nothing to my blood pressure then she put me on 5mg small improvement but still 130 systolic at its best with 140150 in the mornings on 5mg diastolic was staying in healthy range most of time this far into things my anxiety had started to diminish i was assured by the ekg and echo results and i was starting to get blood pressure under control but symptoms still persisted
""
most recent doctors visit was for symptoms and i had a pulmonary function test done that came back normal
""
fast forward to current situation i am now on 10mg of lisniprol taking it at night instead of morning i work out daily running for 2040min and strength training twice a week my blood pressure is now 120130 systolic most of the time and 6070 diastolic  my pulse readings are within 5570 usually if i do get a reading higher i think its because i havent waited long enough after standing and i just sit longer and it goes down
""
so now that my blood pressure is mostly under control im still experiencing shortness of breath and chest tightness i have not smoked marijuana in over a month the dyspnea feels like i have a hard time getting enough air on the inhale and i have no issues exhaling the tightness in my chest is just uncomfortable and just feels like theres pressure the chest tightness is located on the left side of my chest i also have a dry cough but attribute that to a side effect of lisniprol
""
i understand these are symptoms of anxiety but i find myself with these symptoms when im perfectly calm ive always been a gaming enthusiast i play most of my games seriously as silly as that sounds and i have a difficult time focusing because of my symptoms thats the least of my worries but what im saying is even when i try to occupy myself these symptoms arise ive also started meditation and my symptoms effect me when im perfectly calm and have accepted the uncomfortable nature of what im experiencing
""
during exercise my symptoms are very noticeable more then i remember when i was a highschool wrestler getting in shape i have only been working out for about 2 weeks now with more intensity
""
during meditation i do breathing techniques and on deep breaths in total silence i hear a faint fine crackle this crackle is not with every breath but varies in intensity it sounds as if its coming from the back of my head as odd as that sounds ive been doing meditation off and on for 6 months or more and i have always heard this i dont have to be meditating for this to happen i just notice it more when i am because i am in silence doing deep controlled breath work
""
ive mentioned this to my doctor but she hasnt heard anything with a stethoscope when shes listened its not a period in which im able to hear these crackles either im not sure even if my lungs were crackling if the person could be able to hear it so the crackle i hear may be totally unrelated
""
i have absolutely no medical background but through the power of google i have some possible diagnosis i have acid reflux which could effect my lungs psychosomatic dyspnea i know this next one is extremely rare for someone my age but early stage lung cancerpancoast tumor partially collapsed lung although im not sure if the last two diagnosis would be able to pass a pulmonary function test
""
this could all be hypochondriacanxiety but from my personal perception the correlation is not there i feel like if it was anxiety causing these symptoms i wouldnt be experiencing these things when i would consider myself calm and content i also wouldnt be experiencing these things when im playing a video game that im trying to put my full focus into when these symptoms arise if they do provoke a emotional response its frustration because im in the middle of doing something that i now feel uncomfortable and can no longer enjoy to the full extent
""
sorry for the lengthy read but much love and appreciation to anyone that decides to respond
hello everyone
""
this is pretty much a plea out into the universe for help lol
im going to tell you guys about all the things wrong with me in hopes that maybe someone will have an answer ive been to multiple doctors but its pretty much been a shrug and sucks to be you response
""
anyways here i go
""
for reference i am a 17 year old caucasian female
living in western canada im around 160 pounds 55 and i am not pregnant before anyone asks lol i do not regularly drink or smoke weed cigarettes or vapes
""
when i was about 12 or 13 i started getting major canker sores in my mouth i can get up to 15 at a time and they are very painful i do have another post just describing my cankers and along with this i also had a very hard time falling asleep i went to one doctor about both of these multiple times and he did not do anything for me about the cankers
after we tried melatonin and different meds he finally prescribed a sleeping pill although it did not help falling asleep
""
then i went to a different doctor who tried to put me on oral herpes medication which did not help after taking for months
i have been getting frequent yeast infections which is really more annoying than anything
""
now 17 years old for the past 6 months or so ive been feeling very nauseous in the mornings and whenever i after i eat its gotten to the point where i force myself to drink water then throw it up in the mornings as well as force myself to throw up if i eat too much
""
one doctor i went to thought it may be acid reflux so she prescribed a medication it did not help after taking for months
""
i am constantly tired and lethargic i also have started being very thirsty so i am now using the washroom constantly after i use the washroom i usually feel cramplike pain in my stomach
""
my period cramps are very intense as well i have to take 23 naproxen just for the pain to subside i also find myself getting these cramps even when i am not on my period
""
i have become very angry i am not a very angry person i find myself getting very irritated at small things very easily which did not happen before a year or so ago
""
i find myself not having much of an appetite especially with burgers for some reason hehe
its bad especially when i do not have an appetite i feel more of a need to throw up this need does not go away until i force myself to get sick
""
i do not think i am gluten free i have been tested for food allergies i only have environmental allergies i do not believe i have herpes as my cankers started before i was sexually active  but i have still always used protection
the last time the doctors took my blood they said everything was normal
""
one of my problems is that i have a hard time pushing for tests and such my dad says i need to be more aggressive
""
does anyone have any suggestions i can ask my doctors about or at least anything that i can research on my own
it would be greatly appreciated
""
thank you

hi
""
i know this is something i should probably be tested for but due to the covid19 situation im unable to visit a doctor also im a student and my citys student clinic isnt very helpful unless youre in a really bad situation this isnt interfering with my daily life its just something ive noticed happening at specific situations which i will describe
""
i think its important to mention that ive had anxiety and depression for at least 10 years of my life but ive only been officially diagnosed 2 years ago my doctor has only prescribed me meds for my sleeping problems due to my anxiety she hasnt done any tests so i dont have anything to base my issue on except my experience 2 years ago i also had really bad and frequent panic attacks they got better from the time being theyve become less frequent the past year on average ive been getting them once every 23 months generally my mental health is pretty manageable as ive learned to cope with most stuff by myself throughout the years
""
so as the title says ive noticed sensitivity to flashing images and lights ive started noticing this issue 2 years ago the same period when i had frequent panic attacks i started noticing they happened at parties i dont go to them often maybe once or twice a month i dont have issues with crowded places and social situations the first few times i thought it was just a panic attack as my symptoms were identical to one dizziness lightheadedness numbness in my right leg i never fainted or lost consciousness it never went beyond general discomfort and dizziness but ive started noticing that they appeared when there were flashing lights i first thought my symptoms appeared due to weedalcohol but they started getting less intense through time at periods never even appearing in the past year it has happened maybe like 2 times the symptoms would quickly go away as soon as i looked away covered my eyes or the lights simply stopped flashing and i get back to normal
""
well last week i was watching a movie and there were rapid flashing images and i felt the symptoms coming on i covered my eyes and it took 2 minutes for the symptoms to go away this has never happened before outside of parties so thats why im issuing my concern
""
i will talk to my doctor about it as soon as i get the chance i still have a lowkey fear that my concern might be disregarded though as it has happened before with other stuff lol
""
i would just like a general opinion could my symptoms get worse over time i dont want to diagnose but could this be a sign of epilepsy or is it something else is it a reaction triggered by anxiety is there a known treatment for this or should i just avoid flashing lights and images as much as possible
ever since i was 11 years old i have been experiencing strange feelings of time moving very fast like fast forwarding a tape and weightlessness noticing how light my phone is and how hard i am gripping it
""
last month i experienced my first for this year in which i hallucinated my bed falling through my ceiling causing me to run quickly down the stairs to scare my parents about the whole situation it is important to note that i experienced both symptoms that i started earlier during this experience as well as the hallucinations
""
i am typing this while i am experiencing the second for this year and i am stumped as to what it could be i have realised the possibility of it being some sort of anxiety or panic attack however i have been to the doctors previously to get it checked out and they could not diagnose it in case it helps i am 15 years of age

any input is appreciated thanks
height 61 weight 150ish not taking any meds ive played soccer through high school i may have rolled my ankle once or twice in the past tho it was never that bad pain would be gone after a few days ive noticed this for the longest time but it hasnt really affected me so i never looked into it now im just curious about it
""
""
""
i dont really know how to describe it but it feels like my right ankle is heavier when i try to rotate both feet in circular motions the right ankle feels more solid than the left ankle also the right one makes an audible clicking sound when i rotate it i also dont feel like i have the same full control of the range of motion like i do on the left one also my right calf tightens more than my left when i rotate my ankles can anyone explain what this is

there are also times when i feel like my stomach is full of something so i go to the toilet expecting something huge but then nothing but air comes out and i feel like a balloon deflating i was told by someone in my family that it may be aerophagia but i never really documented myself on it so i dont know if its actually this and since it wasnt that annoying i didnt look further into it
""
i dont have a particular diet i dont eat junk food all the time i try to eat more vegetables and organic food there may be the fact that me and my family have been eating less meat than usual recently but this problem occurred way before that
""
theres also the fact that i burp a lot more when playing games particularly games that require high levels of concentration and induce stress and  or frustration is it normal to burp more when angered or frustrated

ive been having some elbow pain for the past years that i havent been doing anything about except avoiding the things that provoke it this mostly means bicep curls and forcing my elbow into extension normally my elbow wont lock out fully unless i use an extra bit of effort but i try to avoid that when i force my arm into extension theres a crunching sound in the elbow especially if i rotate my wrist with straight arms both arms are affected but the right is worse

but ive been doing more calisthenics training recently and some movements irritate it like handstand training ive payed more attention to what happens and i get a little bit of tingling and numbness in my pinky and ring finger so i assume its an impinged ulnar nerve i cant see a physiotherapist at the moment because of quarantine is there anything else i can do ive been doing nerve flossing exercises carefully for the past week but so far theres no relief

primary complaint hot shower water up my nose worried about amoebas
""
duration 1 day
""
i was taking a shower this morning and when i tilted my head to wash my face the shower water got into my nose i was holding my breath and didnt actively inhale it but it went in far enough that i could feel it trickle down my throat it really inflamed my whole nosethroatmouth pallet area for like a good hour i heard the water needs to get into your sinuses to infect you but if it trickled back down my throat and irritated that whole passage way it must have been pretty far up right
""
i live in japan and tap water here is chlorinated but from what i can find from my city chlorine levels might only be like 1mgl by the time it reaches buildings n fowleri amoeba need 5mgl to be disinfected and they thrive in hot water heaters so if theres amoeba in the hot water tank in my building then the 1mgl of chlorine wont be enough to disinfect it plus my building is super old and im pretty sure the pipes arent very good so who knows whats in the water i am already so stressed with everything going on i dont know what to do symptoms can take 212 days to show up so i feel like im just waiting to die now

okay so a little over probably 5 months ago i was masturbating like any horny teenager but it was for my 4th time ever i had noticed that every time i did it a little while after my hearing would become completely absent for around 3 seconds or i would seem to run out of energy completely but on my 4th time i finished while on my knees and i remember around 5 seconds after or so my hearing quickly ramped out of existence as a very loud ringing sound replaced what would otherwise be a fan that i could hear the position i fell into was rather uncomfortable as i was still on my knees though i feel all the way backwards onto my back its hard to remember but i know during this episode i heard a lot of talking and still the ringing without being able to see at all the talking felt almost as if i went into a dream this whole thing lasted about 15 seconds i would say although im not completely sure once i became conscious i could still hear the ringing while i didnt have any hearing from outside of my body within a second or two my hearing ramped back into existence and i was able to move although i didnt get up right away due to my extreme level of confusion and the state of mild shock i was in i noticed there was drool on my face and i dont even drool in my sleep i just sat in my bed after that surprised at what i witnessed the rest of the day and the day after that it felt a bit like my general coordination was off im basing this off the fact that after that happened i went and played basketball and i felt drained of energy as well as my footing while i run or walk being shitty the next day it felt the same and i dont know if ive gained what i lost for those two days or if i just got used to being uncoordinated like so please someone respond i tried doing research on this topic and found absolutely nothing on masturbation causing a seizure i havent told anyone about this due to the inappropriate time where this happened

few months ago i visited an ent specialist regarding my loss of sense of smell and general nasal allergies he gave me tablets a spray and a netipot and recommend some surgical operation for permanent comfort after i finished college now due to the pandemic i cannot get it done and sneezing has gotten worse because i wasnt using the spray consistently which kept me wondering about this prescriptionhttpsimgurcomfqfhhar as the doctor didnt give me much details anyway

is it really necessary to go through with the surgery is it related to the sharp striking painfeels like someone is poking knife and hurts more if i breathe deeply i get in my chest after mid body workouts

there has been a smell coming from my pantry for the last several days that i havent been able to identify today i opened the door and just got hit with this wall of fumes and i decided enough was enough i spent about half an hour tearing it apart and smelling every single thing in it by the time i identified the potatoes and threw them out i was feeling pretty terrible my head kills im super nauseous and im having chest pains
""
i looked it up online and read that rotten potato fumes can be extremely toxic but its hard to tell if im feeling awful because of toxins or because the smell and activity triggered flares of my preexisting conditions see below its not uncommon for me to experience chest pains just from walking around the kitchen for a while and i have a headache and nausea for the better part of most days as it is it feels worse than normal but not so much worse that it couldnt be a heightened version of the regular stuff
""
that being said i have been experiencing some other unexplained symptoms over the last few weeks that i wonder might have been caused by inhaling the fumes before they were as noticeable ive been experiencing random spikes in temperature 996100 that last for about 1218 hours go away and then pop back up again a few days later ive also lost weight from 122 to 111 in less than a month with no changes in diet and ive had pretty bad diarrhea and abdominal pain too mostly upper right but it kinda moves around ive also had really bad dry eyes and dry mouth my rheumatologist has suspected sjogrens for a while and ordered a lip biopsy recently so thats happening soon i also have had a sore throat kinda burns probably related to dry mouth and swollen glands
""
i have an unrelated diagnostic laparoscopy scheduled for next month and theyre going to test me for covid before that i dont think i have covid and neither does my doctor mostly because the fever has been so offandon and ive had no cough at all but ill be tested in the next few weeks regardless

i just dont know how to tell whether the worsened symptoms im experiencing should be worrying me or not i sent a message to my doctor but the office doesnt open for several hours and she probably wont see my message until the end of the work day anyway thats the time of day she usually sends me messages if theres a chance im experiencing poisoning what steps should i take to manage it until i hear from my doctor

for the past weeks ive been noticing i go more frequently to the bathroom and that my urine sinks inmediately on the toilet clear water on the top and urine on the bottom
""

thanks for the help
hiya

im a 21f on no regular medication
""
so in october 2019 i had a pretty bad cold meaning i was sneezing a lot and having to blow my nose every now and again i tried to not do this a lot as when i was younger i used to have tons of nosebleeds which resulted in having a procedure that burns the veins i dont know what its called exactly but it gave me a weird dark patch under my nostril for a while
""
anyway nosebleeds subsided for years and would only rarely get them
""
cue this cold and i had 2 nosebleeds in 2 days 1st one was just standard all good a few bits of tissue or something next day it happens again but a couple pieces of gross monstrosity come out my nose
""
heres a link but disclaimer im being gross moving it around i didnt post it on snapchat i recorded it on there to send to my mum to see what she thought lol
""
httpsimgurcomau5813r0
""
anyway
""
since then my nostrils have not been having a good time i was pretty blocked up for a couple months and i was too scared to blow my nose or pick for gold to be able to breathe better
""
however in february i got brave i started just like wiping my nose without picking or blowing and id notice a bit of dry blood in my mucus sometimes still fresh blood this has been happening every day whenever i wipe my nose
""
last couple days ive been feeling a bit out of breath anxiety and so i was like i need to breathe better so i picked as gently as i could to not aggravate the nostril powers that be and there was bloody mucus i picked out some mucus and then it was just bloody patches on the tissue my other nostril also sometimes has dried blood in mucus but never wet so im guessing its coming from my homeboy right nostril i got a little worried cause i think 5 months is enough time to give my nostrils to recover
""
i conducted an inconclusive test i rolled a bit of tissue and put it up my non problem nostril and there was a bit of dried blood and mucus tried again and there was no active bleeding then i did homebody nostril and bam found the source of blood to be the very top of the canal so there was no blood on the sides of the tissue just on the tip
""
im writing on here because i feel embarrassed to come forward with such a stupid problem in these times to call my gp whos currently helping with other unrelated issues so im also sorry to you doctors on here im asking but i was wondering if you had any insight as to
""
""
 what this could be
 can i let this be and hope it will resolve itself
""
""
thank you
""
""
tldr had a nosebleed 5 months ago affected nostril has been hard to breath through since due to constant dry blood and mucus clogging it up found out this week the source of blood is from the top of my nostril canal idk what to do and feel embarrassed about talking to my gp

i am 34m 175m height weight around 70kg white no known relevant medical conditions my work is mild manual labor not intensive in the past few days ive been feeling recurring tingling in my left pinky it feels like its on the way to getting numb but doesnt quite get there this lasts for maybe 1015 minutes
loosening or removing my watch strap did not make a difference
a basic google search suggested carpal tunnel which i dont know much about but i will point out that i dont use a computer much when i do its only for a few minutes no more than 23 times a day i do use a cellphone a lot dont know if thats relevant
there were other things the google search suggested some of which require a doctors attention
since going to the doctor nowadays is complicated and a little risky id like to know if this is something that i should go to a doctor about knowing that google searches for medical advice are notoriously bad ideas and if so whether or not its okay to wait until the coronavirus situation has calmed a little here id also appreciate advice on what might be able to do to alleviate the problem especially if its okay to wait with seeing my doctor
many thanks

my fingers are often cold yesterday after sitting in the sun for ten minutes my body was warm but my fingers were still a bit cold so my fingers being a little cold is actually the normal situation for me
""
i dont have obvious color changes like white fingers so it doesnt seem like raynauds
however when being outside during winter even when wearing gloves my hands will turn bluepurple and sometimes with orange dots  my hands also hurt quite a lot during winter
""
and sometimes when pressing on the skin it will stay white for several seconds only on my hands
""
on the opposite when its hot my hands become very warm and will turn red if i dont cool them with water or when i dont get out of the sun this may hurt as well
""
last thing when im playing tennis for example the hand i use most will stay cold as well instead of getting warm because of exercise
or one or two fingers will get warm and the others will stay cold this does also occur sometimes when using my pc mouse
""
my friends and family know me for my weird hands so it really does stand out my grandma used to have some of these problems as well according to my mother dont know how similar
""
several doctors said its nothing to worry about and its just caused by the combination of my length and weight
""
my parents suspected anemia so i made sure to eat more ironrich food didnt work
""
i have these problems since i was about 13 years old i think
""
maybe its really nothing to worry about but i wanted to check it here thanks for your time

i just woke up from sleeping because i felt that i needed to use the restroom i dont know why but my blankets had felt wet i didnt think anything of it because i usually put my blankets over my head when im sleeping and leave a little hole for me to breathe on my nose i remember getting all sweaty from the face and thats why my blankets had felt wet i went to go pee real quick and came back and laid in bed i dont know what happened but something happened in my mind it was really scary i randomly started to feel like there was a large long bullet that was right next to my body like it was the size of my body and longer than me i thought i was in a tank of some sort and i randomly started to think about kim jong un i began to panic and think random crazy thoughts and they wouldnt stop ive had this feeling before when on flu medication when i was very sick i had random thoughts of numbers rushing through my head and it wouldnt stop for 5 mins this time that it happened just seems to weird to me that it happened it stopped when i picked up my phone like i just snapped out of it im currently having trouble trying to explain what it is i went through im not sure if that was a panic attack or anxiety attack because im not sure if that was what it was if you have any questions please ask and ill do my best to respond i probably wont be able to sleep for a couple hours because of how scary that was

ive been suffering from terrible ankle pain starting around the beginning of the year 4 months really only when im sleepingill reposition and awake with awful stiffnesspain in my left ankle its just excruciating
""
i had a bad bike accident in december fractured pelvis road rashbanged up on my left side i twisted my left ankle and it was quite bruised and swollen but never really hurt or hindered my mobility was on crutches for awhile xrays were not done on my anklefoot at the time and issues didnt really emerge until i was more or less over the hip injury the top of my footankle looked swollen when id point my foot for some time but ive noticed the last couple of weeks that this swelling has subsided
""
i think its tendinitis but what can i do about it particularly during lockdown ive tried rice protocol icing during daybefore bed etc and pain meds tried ibuprofen paracetamol naproxen before bed dont really seem to make a difference ive tried to see if theres a pattern to the pain is it betterworse if im moreless active during the day does biking versus walking for activity make a difference at night and nothing seems to make sense
""
would something topical help like tiger balm or bengay etc are there stretches or anything i can do to mitigate the pain at night ive been tempted to rig something up to keep my foot flexed at night because the prone position seems to be what wrecks me lol any advice

hi im 14m and ive had a fungal skin infection on both sides of my nose which makes the skin flaky red and itchy that has lasted for around 10 months i have eczema but i dont think that its the cause as ive tried to use the medication used to treat it but it wont work the doctor prescribed me a topical antifungal cream which did stop the infection for about a month before it came back and its been coming and going since im afraid that the fungi might have developed resistance against the cream i am also sure that i used it long enough so that all the fungi was killed is there a medication that i can use for this without a prescription  not eager to go to a doctor during the outbreak  or are there ways i can eliminate it for good at home and avoid it in the future

i had a mri done for my herniated disc a few months ago and they found a mass on the upper part of my kidney my doctor asked for another mri with contrast this time specific for the kidney i posted here a few weeks ago about this
""
as i could only get appointment for the next mri with 2 and a half months away from the first i told my doctor i was concerned this was too far apart and that i was having some mild pain in my flanks same side as where the mass was found so she ordered an ultrasound of the area with the us images in they said they are confident that the mass is an angiomyolipoma which is benign so i got relieved even though i still feel some mild pain
""
fast forward a few weeks i started feeling some weird pain on my armpit its a mix between stinging pain and burning sensation and i noticed there is a little bumpsphere less than 1cm wide very superficial but not visible that i can easily locate it with my fingers but only under one armpit could this be a lymph node if the kidney mass is in fact an aml benign any reason the lymph nodes would be inflamed
""
i dont have any other inflammation going on that i am aware of i dont leave my house for weeks so i dont have a cold flu anything really
""
initially i thought this armpit bump could be an ingrown hair or pimple but its there for 1011 days now and it doesnt get smaller or less painful
""
i still have the kidneyspecific mri scheduled for next month is this armpit little bump something to be concerned about should i make an appointment with my doctor to let her know about this before the mri happens next month
""
any advice is appreciated thank you
hello im a male 27 years old 6 foot 2 inches tall and 160 lbs i have a multitude of issues apperently and im getting a tad bit worried theyre connected in some way i really hope somebody can give me some sort of idea of what is going on here
""
 my left knee was in pain and i felt a distinct popping in it while walking if i bend the knee i can feel a bunch of movement in the knee cap there was also a bunch of tightness in the hamstring of that same leg i put myself on crutches for a week to rest the leg when i put like 25 of my weight on that leg today all that tightness of the hamstring came back the knee has also been stinging for the last hour its like its kinda burning
""
 that same burning sensation is also occuring in my right shins and what i believe are the tendons between my shins and my foot its not nearly as bad as the left leg but having said that my right leg has also been carrying all of my weight for a week
""
 my vocal chords feel very strained after only like 15 minutes of a having a normal volume chat with someone there is also some pressure in my sinus forhead and eyes
""
 i have a bunch of what i believe are tendon issues in both shoulders my left shoulder is quite bad in particular i can feel burning in them just typing this
""
 this stinging burning stuff is also being felt in new places seemingly everyday despite resting my self this past week i felt a little in my lower back earlier and just this second i felt the same stinging in my left temple
""
 ive felt my stomach growling kinda a lot over the past week despite the fact that i went from being very active to basically inactive my weight is also surprisingly low i saw my lowest weight ever today 157 i do track my calories and i am taking in 2300 i researched an approproate amount of calories to intake for someone who is sedentary but recovering from an injury id assume that was enough but my stomachs been growling quite a bit
""
the leg issues only started a couple weeks ago 1 week ago i decided to take a break and give them a rest ive been sitting around all week except to eat and all that but like none of these issues have improved even a little i understand the shoulders not getting better since they are supporting me while on the crutches and yes the fact that my right leg has to support some more weight than normal mightnt be doingit any favours but im also simply doing way way less activity than normal id assume that that would make it feel a bitbetter but it actually feels pretty crappy right now is this all connected i have previous posts about some of these things in case anyone wanted to see more in depth what i had to say about any of these particular issues id massively appreciate any responses
i dont know if its a piece of wood or a thorn because this went through the back of my left leg while i was walking
""
on the first few days there was a sharp stabbing pain when i felt the area or even walked now its not sharp pain but there is pain
""
it hurts a lot more than i think a splinter should and it makes me limp when i walk the area has been firm all week not a lot of redness the size of swelling is the size of a quarter give or take and the entry wound is still there probably 23 millimeters in diameter
""
when we squeeze the area to clean it yesterday a waterywhite liquid came out mixed blood i have no idea if thats pus or not it wasnt slow it was like a pop and a lot came out same thing this morning
""
how deep could this fucker be what is my next step i cant just keep going to the er if they are just gonna send me home after 5 hours of sitting in a bed and doing nothing

so im due to give birth soon im really scared of the side effects of epidurals but then also scared of not coping without one im based in the uk i have a history of tachychardia heart going up to 166 when i get anxious not even a full blown panic attack just a tiny bit of anxiety can trigger it its been checked in hospital and although atrial flutter was originally suspected they said it was purely anxiety and sensitivity to adrenaline i do manage to bring my heart rate down very quickly with breathing and never had to take beta blockers
""
now are things going to be ok if i get an epidural as i read that one of the rare side effects cause cause cardiac accidents ive asked my midwife lots of times and she said yes but would love to hear confirmation from a doctor if possible my worry is that my heart rate will definitely be fast when they do the epidural because ill be scared and then react badly to it
""

secondly also freaking out about the paralysis risks how rare is it are they meant to do a blood test to check the blood clotting beforehand as i didnt get one

existing conditions ehlers danlos hypermobility type asthma
i recently have developed a sensation that there is a tight band around by foot just below the ankle i could not figure out how to describe it other than that but a quick google search and im thinking its tight sock syndrome im also having frequent muscle twitches in that leg the tight feeling is worse in certain positions but appears to be getting worse in general even when im just lying down normally it is not constant but very frequent i am currently getting a neurological workup because of concerns over muscle weakness tremulousness and chronic fatigue i also have been having issues with dizziness and vision loss when standing which fades after time and my heart pounds and i feel short of breath from very little exertion also having trouble starting to urinate and constipation
the workup includes a brain mri blood tests and electromyography however testing wont begin until the 12th of may im also going to have a sleep study soon because of sleeping problems
should i inform my neurologist of the tight sock sensation or is it not needed due to the existing treatment plan also i was wondering if anyone has theories on what could be going on with me
hiya guys i know internet shouldnt be the first place i consult for most medical conditions but my city is under lockdown and hospital is in chaos so i wouldnt like going there rn
anyways about four days ago my tonsils became sore when i woke up i never had a problem with something like this so i dont know what to expect googled it said drink eat hotcold to make it bearable take some antibiotics for pain and rest i do that but it doesnt seem to bulge a little better when i take something hot and painkiller but thats it how dangerous this can get how to know when to quit after 10 days
also no other symptoms just sore tonsils that are pressing my throat 21m

back at the end of january my son got sick in the middle of the day he broke out into a fever and became very sleepy fussy but no breathing issues the fever got bad enough 1023 that he started to have a seizure however this was without a doubt the worst one he ever had he was convulsing or shaking uncontrollably stopped breathing several times 3 rescue meds did not work until he eventually came out of it after about 25 minutes
""
""
""
we know that some symptoms are fever chills tiredness uncontrollably shaking breathing trouble but the rest of the symptoms we cant assess with him because he is nonverbal so we cant ask about his sense of smell or taste or anything like that the only observation the doctor made was that he might have an ear infection the kicker for us is that this sounded so much like the flu the doctor even said they were positive it was the flu because so many other kids had been in the er recently with those same symptoms but when they tested for the flu it came back negative

so ive only really passed out three times in my life i dont remember the first time too well just that i was walking across my hallway and passed out before i got to the bathroom randomly
""
the second time i had just gotten my wisdom teeth out so well chalk it up to that
""
the last time was right before the fourth of july i know it was awhile ago but i had hip surgery the following month so i had other health issues in the spotlight i had been eating and drinking all day which not eating and standing up quickly for me at times will make my head feel hot and start to lose vision but i dont usually pass out due to that i was putting something in the microwave when the numbers started to disappear and before i knew it was falling forward hit the window and then the floor tried to get up but passed out again
""
ive had two concussions in the span of two years when i was 16 years old im now 20 and im not considered overweight or unhealthy ive talked to doctors about the dizziness before so they monitored my bp for a month and by that time it was still unclear of what the issue was ive not gotten bloodwork before expect to be tested for stdsti before my surgery last august
""
im just curious to see if anyone may have an answer or suggestion the only possible answers ive gotten is hypotension which my bp tends go up when i stand but mostly my heart rate with around 120 bpm at times but quickly goes down after a moment of standing and vertigo

any help is appreciated

this has been happening since my 7th month of pregnancy which left me bedridden it started as weakness and lower back pain with braxton hicks except they were unusual because one contraction would get tighter and tighter and would last until i laid down on my left side regardless of being well hydrated prenatal scans and labs were all normal except low iron this started around 27 weeks with a uti which was treated with antibiotics the uti cleared up but my other symptoms persisted and got worse this quickly progressed and by 32 weeks i had to stop working as i was too weak and in pain so much upon standing i got so lightheaded that i almost fell many times sitting in an upright position or standing put so much downward pressure on my legs that they felt like they were going to pop off from the amount of pressure they were extremely heavy and ached my pelvis and lower back always felt heavy and ached like menstrual pain but worse soon the only position i could tolerate being in was to lay on my left side every other position produced those very strong continuous braxton hicks
""
i attribute the feeling in my pelvis lower back and legs to blood pooling now that im aware thats what was happening i had a normal vaginal delivery the downward pressure on my legs was replaced with the flood gates from my pelvis to my legs opening up and started swelling in my legs orthostatic intolerance persisted leg pain got worse again it was at this time that the veins in my legs became more prominent even sitting up made them accumulate fluid and hurt no one seemed to agree that they looked swollen though i attribute this to the fact that they probably just looked fat i had just had a baby and had extra weight after all however they get a blotchy red or turn a blue hue when im sitting upright or standing
""
occasional abdominal pain no real pattern there as to when it happens but its mostly in the belly button and pelvic region
""
postprandial hypotension to the point of feeling very weak and unable to stay awake after eating
""
early satiety amp no appetite so i eat about once a day and have the occasional snack at some other point that symptom has been with me since midpregnancy and persists still
""
didnt really have the sensation of having to pee for a long time after delivery like the fluid in my body would just accumulate in my legs and not go to my bladder unless id been laying down for a while with my legs elevated makes for a lot of trips to the bathroom at night that one is a little better but i find that i still have to get up and go pee 23 times before i can sleep in peace
""
the pain and heaviness in my pelvis and lower back persisted with that menstrualpain like ache constantly this has slowly gotten a little better over the last 6 months however i have reached a plateau i still cant even go to the grocery store or stand up and cook without my legs aching burning and feelings of water running down them when theres nothing there even with 2030mmhg thigh highs on the lightheaded feeling is better but im still having terrible brain fog from it and often out of breath just from a walk to the bathroom and back my chest x rays look normal and basic labs cant remember what all they were cbc w diff and sed rate a couple others but cant remember were normal no ddimer though
""
i have an intolerance to heat too makes my swelling lightheadedness aching and everything else so much worse so i dread needing to shower couldnt even do it without a lot of willpower to try not to pass out most of the time id pay for it in pain and dizziness for the rest of the day if i did but that has slightly improved to where i can shower more often and be able to tolerate it a little bit better now
""
all of this the pain the orthostatic symptoms the swelling heaviness from the waist down it all gets worse just before my period and is worse for a couple weeks
""
i am breastfeeding so i just stick to taking tylenol and ibuprofen but i have stayed maxed out on these for months now on almost a dialy basis
""
ive been thinking i may have some venous insufficiency in my pelvis since it seemed to start there and the swelling and pain is the entire length of both my legs along with pain and heaviness in my pelvis and lower back ive gotten pretty devoted to the idea that i do but what are some other things you would look into and how might you approach this
20m 5ft9 65kg white no medical conditions and i dont smoke or drink
i keep getting a sharp pain in both of my knees when i stand up from sitting down or bend it about 90degrees ive had this before but it kind of went away on its own its not painful constantly just mainly when i put weight on it while its bent i have seen people test knee pain by moving the knee cap side to side and mine seem very tight and dont want to move while my leg is relaxed its been happening for about a week but since the physios are closed ive come to reddit
hope thats enough information

i went and got a blood test today i walked out completely fine hadnt passed out or felt dizzy but 5 minutes later by vision started fading to the point where it became completely and i mean completely black it stayed full on black for 5 minutes and i just kept feeling around walking trying to walk back into the clinic because i was in public and didnt wanna worry people and cause a scene
it was like my eyes were shut despite them being open my ears were ringing but i never once lost consciousness or fell i didnt make it back to the clinic i actually walked myself into a fucking car park like an idiot and was walking in circles lol a lady was concerned and asked me if i was on drugs and gave me a drink after i told her i had just been blood tested my vision started coming back so quickly
i was mortified she told me that my eyes were green and pupils went so big and that there were tears coming out of my eyes but i wasnt crying i was just trying to stay calm while walking and feeling the area around but again i couldnt see at all my ears were ringing and i felt so so hot

i dont know what it was usually if people pass out its sudden and they fall they cant walk and their vision never completely goes unless they go unconscious but i was walking around blind for no joke 510 mins

a few other things about my health that may help
""
im about 7kg underweight my bilirubin and protein in body is excessively high but i dont think that has much to do with it and this event has happened to me a few times when i get a piercing or a needle always after like 5 minutes too so usually i make sure the place im being jabbed is next to a drink shop by this time my vision is almost completely gone but not fully so i can still manage to drink
""
i dont know what happened i didnt stand up fast or anything and it came on after 5 min
has this ever happened to you any ideas

this might end up long but im generally unsure what to do 24f 54 245 lbs white and ive had back problems since i was in high school i never could afford to see an orthopedic surgeon but did get imaging done i only have currently the most recent ct scan at hand which ill include i have had severe sciatica and painnumbness in my legs when sleeping on my back or standing too long its progressed to the point where im getting right sided leg weakness and my hip and outer thigh on that side is completely numb its also hurting much more than usual and i have a golf ball sized lump deep in my right hip i tried to talk to my pcp about it but she simply said theres nothing she can do and gave me the same list of exercises that end up causing more sciatica and pain ive attempted to push through the pain but i cant push through the fiery sharp nerve pain that happens when i lay on my back
""
im currently unemployed and without health insurance to see the doctors i need to see ive been diagnosed with anxiety depression polycystic ovary syndrome fibromyalgia high blood pressure diabetes and a suspected autoimmune disease i take cyclobenzaprine 10mg 2x a day fluoxetine 20mg in the morning metoprolol tartate 50mg 2x a day hydroxyzine 25mg 4x a day as needed but i usually only take 2 losartan 50mg once a day duloxetine 60mg 2x a day metformin 500mg 4x a day and gabapentin 600mg 3x a day i dont drink and ive smoked weed in the past but havent smoked in a few months
""
i suppose what im asking here is if i should be concerned about this and go to an emergency room not due to having an emergency but just so i can get some sort of help i dont qualify for medicaid or other financial assistance as it is im still struggling a year later trying to save up to get my galbladder removed as it frequently gives me a lot of pain

hi i have a middle ear infection ive been getting them repeatedly for a few weeks now ive tried several antibiotics and every time they almost clear it and then ill wake up one morning and have a huge pressure buildup which hurts like hell this then pops a day or two later and then the discharge begins
""
the discharge is a weird thing its really runny but once it reaches the septum and exterior skin it dries up and becomes a really flaky wax it stinks i cannot stress enough how bad it smells i use a towel on my pillow which i boil wash every day ready for the night when i wake up in the mornings i feel really sick the smell is bad but i also have this awful taste in the back of my mouth the combination makes me feel sick
""
so i was under the impression that the infection was fungal but i find it weird that the fluid that comes out is so thin and water like the leaking also comes with a lovely side portion of dizzy like i just drank half a bottle of whiskey kind of dizzy so i was wondering if theres a chance the fluid is actually cochlea fluid or whatever the fluid that helps you balance is called rather than water or liquid fungus i dont really know much about ear anatomy i dont know how this would work but if theres a chance it is the balancing fluid does that fluid regenerate at any point or am i gonna have to have fluid surgically planted back in my ear
""
i should also mention that i have a preexisting perforation in my ear drum that has been there for 3 years and never healed i got it in a lifeguarding course and so there might be a chance theres been water in there for years and its just coming out again i dont know how likely this is im not a doctor i should also mention that my family has a history of ear infections my dad has had surgery to enlarge his ear canal and my uncle and grandad have both had ear problems that i dont really know the details of
""
my doctor said it would clear in 35 days and it does tend to be almost clear after this period but then i get another pressure buildup and it repeats
""
so basically my question is whats wrong with me do i need to worry and what would be the best course of action
ive been to the doctors more times than i can count about this but it always comes back after a few weeks ive tried sprays ear drops antibiotics but eventually the ear infection comes back
""
it ranges from me not being able to hear properly to being extremely painful to discharge coming out and right now its bled but im not sure if its from where ive rubbed it or because its worsening i woke up and my pillowcase had blood on it my ear definitely wasnt bleeding when i was awake so im certain it happened when i was asleep
""
if its worth mentioning this all started after using an old pair of earphones stupid i know ive stopped using earbuds completely now and avoid getting water in my ears but nothing seems to have stopped it from happening
""
im worried that because its gone on for so long its going to have an permanent impact on my ears is this likely to happen

after a cold around 3rd feb i began having quite severe nasal congestion and bloody mucus i ignored this as i thought it was just the ending of my cold
""
after about 5 weeks i went to the doctor as it was impacting on the quality of my life i cant breathe through it without nasal strips  even then its difficult i noticed i had sores  inside my nose which had pus on them as well as little tiny clear blisters and bleeding of the walls of my nose the doctor thought it was nasal vestibular furunculosis and gave me naseptin after 15 weeks of applying it it didnt work and i was feeling breathless so they gave me a weeks worth of flucloxacillin it seemed to help a bit i felt better in myself and the blisters etc seemed to go but the swelling and redness stayed
""
the gp then told me to take antihistamines which i did for 2 weeks but it didnt help i also tried saline rinses and a humidifier which didnt relieve it
""
i had my nose swabbed and it showed negative for bacteria i also just got my nose swabbed to check for herpes inside the nose but i dont have the results yet however i thought herpes inside the nose didnt last 12 weeks and i havent had a cold sore on my lip in about 5 years or more
""
i also have been having other symptoms which the gp thinks could be gerdgord or post nasal drip vomiting for a week difficultly eating breathlessness for 12 weeks chest pain  ive been at aampe checked out for these symptoms i also have been getting a tingling sensation on and around my upper cheeks and nose sometimes
""
im waiting to see an ent specialist but the gp said they wont reopen until covid 19 is dealt with so im not sure when that will be and my nasal problems are severely impacting on my life and anxiety i find it hard to sleep and breathe and im still getting bloody discharge and clumps from my nose the gp says theyre confused about what could be causing my nasal problems

this has been going on for about 6 months at first it was a tiny drop here and there and i assumed allergies about 4 months ago i thought it was worrisome and went to the er and the doctor completely wrote it off suggested some dayquil and gave a chest xray to check for pneumonia which it wasnt my primary care doctor had an appointment set up with ent and at the first one they suggested nasal rinses and some allergy medications these did not change anything there was a followup scheduled but then the covid hit and they all had to cancel all unnecessary appointments i thought i could wait it out and reschedule but this has been getting worse

i get mildly dizzy sometimes my head hurts but not in the not enoughtoo much caffeine or standard headache way instead its a weird sense of pressure on a pain scale its not bad id say 210 or 310 but its frequent the dripping if i let it run is enough to soak the pillow at night or make a sizable small puddle on the floor theres no mucus the taste is very much like tears all of the web searches ive done have implied it to be cerebrospinal fluid from a torn membrane which fits what im experiencing its only one nostril its constant around the time it started i was involved in a contact sport fullarmored swordfighting so its possible this was a head trauma of some kind though i dont recall anything bad and i was using proper protective gear
""
""
the trouble that im experiencing is this normally id go to the er that seems pointless considering i was more or less dismissed last time i could call my primary care but this is seeming urgent and i believe they have cancelled all nonurgent appointments as well with covid and obviously needing an actual treatment how do i best proceed

something weird started happening to me last year around aprilmay i felt a deja vu accompanied by confusion lightheadedness and chest painheart pang that spread throughout my whole body it lasted only a few seconds but it left me with oppression and anxiety for some time after it happened i could feel that it was about to start because i felt a normal deja vu however as soon as the physical pains arrived the deja vu morphed into a thousand images feelings that i thought i had already lived i also felt detached from reality the thing is that when it stopped i couldnt really remember those images and i just felt a sense of confusion it was a terrible feeling and its really hard to put into words also it happened when i was quite relaxed eg on the train to school reading something on the internet when i was out with friends 5 or more times a day however i have to say that i was going through a stressful time at school and that might have been the cause i stopped having these episodes after a few months
now exactly a year later theyre coming back i havent really experienced an episode as strong as the ones from last year but im getting these deja vus and i feel that they could happen any time now today i felt the strongest episode yet and im afraid i will go back to experiencing them many times a day the only difference is that this isnt a stressful time for me given that im at home and have a lot of time for myself does anyone know what these episodes could be is it anxiety some sorts of panic attacks thank you

have a history of high eye pressure vision just up and to the left of the center of my left eye stopped working like a blind spot i started to try and figure out what to do until it went away took about fifteen minutes i cant get into see an eye doctor because im in the netherlands where apparently you have to see a house doctor before you go to the hospital but all the house doctors are completely filled by coronavirus i cant get through to see a doctor yet

the thing i think that set it off was exerciseironic i started to exercise recently and ive been holding my breath when i do it so i dont wake up my girlfriendsmall apartment

my thinking is if thats all it takes to lose vision then my eye pressure is probably high againits been as high as 53 before and i didnt notice anything im wondering what i can do to lower my eye pressure until i can get some medication ive already looked online but im looking for more information or some sort of confirmation about what ive read

to preface this im a 23 year old male 510 190 lb predominantly east asian  native american  european hyperthyroidism i guess if thats relevant the initial event occurred about 36 hours ago i dont know if this is particularly relevant but before the quarantine went down i was going to get a professional opinion on what i thought was prostatitis

so i was smacking it yesterday and accidentally full fist whacked the top of my erect member i cant explain why while theres no visible bruising or swelling it was reasonably painful and 24 hours later it hurt to beat my meat again i still came it wasnt the best
im not sure if i have a fracture as i think id be in much more pain  but i cant think of any other words besides fracture i think i definitely came close to a fracture because i definitely felt a bend and that was what was initially unpleasant but it also wasnt fullon dick snapped in half abella anderson style
""
it feels very fragile towards the base almost a poprocks kind of sensation and it hurts to get a boner at the moment but not enough to be physically unbearable just very unpleasant
i cant really find help on google and i dont know how else to word it should i talk to a doctor in person or should i just ease off of the baloney pony for the next few days

tldr have ibs got a colonoscopy found hemorrhoids told to eat fiber and not worry about it still worried about it
""
hello all thanks for taking the time as the title says i had a colonoscopy about 2 months ago because i saw an uptick in the amount of blood in my stool i consistently see some every time i use the bathroom but this was a change in symptoms with a higher overall quantity and the blood being present in the actual stool it was red rather than the coffee grounds burgundy that they tell you to watch out for but it was still quite concerning to me and my gi so we decided to go for a colonoscopy they only found inflammation and internal hemorrhoids which seems to be the cause of my issue the treatment i was prescribed was essentially to eat more fiber which as you can imagine is a rather unsatisfactory answer to a symptom like this
""
just for some history i have had quite severe ibs for around 7 years the only specific disease i have been tested for is celiacs which came back negative i have been prescribed viberzi in the past as a treatment for my ibs but it didnt show the results i hoped for
""
i still see blood in my stool somewhat regularly with some days being worse than others today was one of those days where i felt a strong bowel movement coming on and had to rush to the bathroom and after saw a pretty decent amount of blood i try not to be a hypochondriac or alarmist and if they didnt find anything in my colonoscopy overly worrying i am inclined to believe them but it is quite frustrating to continually show a symptom that feels as severe as this and be told to not worry about it which is why i am reaching out to this community for second opinionsadvice

hi all

im a tad confused here i donated platelets for the first time a few weeks ago and i got a letter back saying that my sample has hla antibodies meaning i cannot donated platelets or plasma again from what i understand hla antibodies are common in women and occur after pregnancy blood transfusion or organ transplants
""
im a 25 yo female and i have never had any of these i know for a fact that i have never had an organ transplant and my family is unaware of a blood transfusion i was a premie at 35 weeks who spent some time in an incubator in the nicu but according to my parents i only received iv fluids not blood
""
i assumed it could have been due to a miscarriage that i did not notice but i chatted with my obgyn about it and she feels that is rather unlikely i have always been in birth control an accidental pregnancy is possible but unlikely furthermore the pregnancy would have had to go on long enough for the hla antibodies to develop at which point i should have noticed both the pregnancy and the spontaneous miscarriage
""
what am i missing im just very confused how these antibodies showed up

id appreciate any feedback

finally i had my appointment last week and the doctor prescribed sertraline and amitriptyline im supposed to split the pills in half i admit that i was having a good week when i spoke to the doctor i thought my fear of illness would resolve soon unfortunately what i didnt mention to him is that i need to close my bedroom door and window to read  study in it today i was very scared when i realized that i was writing and did not close the window i need to check under my bed and inside my cupboards to sleep i fear that an animal may be hiding there a cat or a bat i am afraid that a cat can come into my house and lick the top of my water bottle that a bat comes flying into my house and bites me without me noticing it i went to the market to buy food and when a dog passed me on the sidewalk i became very tense i didnt think it could be a problem until today
im 22m south asian past medical history 1 seizure 9 years ago on epilim since then

so about 4 months ago after a buffet in the afternoon i started feeling bloated till close to midnight when i started puking hadnt been to the toilet in between the next day my stools were just fine but i was still feeling sick and i had a high fever 3940 degrees celsius gp prescribed azithromycin paracetamol and some antacid which i took diligently took it for around 10 days fever would subside for a few hours then come back in full force before the fevers stopped
""
during this time i stopped taking epilim as its mentioned not to take epilim together with antacids i did not feel any feeling of drowsiness or confusion during this period however once my fevers stopped and i went back to my daily activities hadnt started on my epilim again yet i had a constant feeling of brain fog like my right hemisphere was blocked specifically and there was a constant pressure on the right side of the back of my head when playing computer games i found it hard to think things just felt different and even alien but i could talk and understand people fine not even sleeping the night fixed this confusion and pressure feeling however after taking my epilim the next day i felt better i have dizziness episodes lasting seconds once a week or two since that day often coupled with ringing in my ears and twitching occurring separately
""
i just want to know if epilim is possibly masking another hidden illness or am i just overthinking stuff thank you

hi everyone

hope you guys can help me out with this annoying problem
""
about a year and a half ago in my mid thirties i started getting red cheeks especially at night and after a shower the redness would stop at the nose but would have redness at the bridge part of the nose  there were no bumps or anything just redness i freaked out cause it looked like the butterfly rash that people with lupus have but from there on out it started to change starting getting bumps on my right cheek red bumps still with redness after that the redness wasnt as present anymore just the red bumps i assumed it was rosacea my mother has it but then my right cheek cleared up and i only had red bumps on my left cheek up until now they come and go some days it looks a mess some days it looks like it has almost cleared up some days the redness is more prevalent like it was when this all started but it goes away real fast the red bumps are the main thing and at this point only on my left cheek im confused on what this can be i do have pictures but i cant add them right now but ill add a picture of what it looks like
""
httpsimgurcomapacz0dqhttpsimgurcomapacz0dq

as you can see there is also a small whitehead looking thing between the red bumps and that is exactly what it is with me sometimes small whiteheads but mostly red bumps sometimes they are more flattened like theyre little red islands

context  i have a olive skin tone i dont drive a lot so sun isnt on my left cheek only dont talk on the phone without headset i do sleep on my left but i try to cut that down to see if it will help

so the past couple of months ive been waking up from sleep and i cant breathe i cant swallow either and so i choke for about ten seconds before i start breathing again i fall asleep again straight away often when i wake again i will wonder if it was a dream or whether it actually happened
""
it happens only about two to three times a week  that i know of i have no idea if it happens more than that as i have no memory of waking up
""
its happened a couple of times when ive been awake and sitting in my chair i will take a small mouthful of liquid and i cannot swallow it my mouth will not even open to allow me to empty my mouth it feels like both pipes have been blocked off i am able to breathe again after about ten seconds
""
the times it takes for me to be able to breathe again are very slowly getting longer and its getting harder to keep reassuring myself that i wont die
if anyone can promise me i wont die from this ill feel a bit better
""
im going to see my gp about this but it might be weeks before i can see them
""
is there any advice in the meantime
i have these hard little lumps inside my earlobes since i can remember they are not noticeable unless you actually pressure the skin from both sides from time to time id say about twice a year or so one of them gets a little swollen and i try to refrain from touching them because if i do it becomes swollen the next day and takes about 2 days to stop
""
this time stupid me fucked with it and it got very swollen noticeably so and has been like this for about 3 days now it seems to me like a cyst  although it does not activelly hurt its extremely unconfortable especially when laying down
""
any advice on medicine or treatment can i fix this without going to the doctor

my problem is this ive been battling a mild but annoying urinary tract infection for a few weeks now it comes and goes but its really annoying ive tried the cranberry and dmannose supplements that usually do the trick but this time they didnt the one remedy that used to work but i havent used in ages is alka seltzer but im trying to determine if it will interfere with my medication and be dangerous to me the pharmacist said it should be ok but since theres no way to contact my cardiologist im worried just making it clear that this is me being overly cautions

one hour later
1 burning sensation is no lonelier in lower arm and is now localized to just the affected fingers
2 throbbing and numbness persists in affected fingers

i tried to get him to attempt some ulnar nerve glides but the moment he flexes and medially rotates his wrist he complains of a very strong burning very little rotation of the wrist is required to achieve this affect he can barely perform any of them before the burning kick in
""
there is no observable swellingbruising around the area of impact if he attempts to massage the area of impact he complains of a pain that radiates up and down the arm
""
it seems as though at the moment of impact the rim of the watch was able to perfectly fit in between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon and smack the ulnar nerve
""
at this point im just trying to see if he needs to go to urgent care or seek immediate medical treatment considering all thats going on right now i dont know how timesensitive this is

i have been waking up and feeling a numbness in my lip its only on the left side of my bottom lip i dont know much about health but i just made sure i could move it fine and everything i can move it fine but the feeling of numbness has been there for 4 days now i figured it would go away but it hasnt i dont think its a constant situation but i do notice it i am able to speak fine i informed a friend about it and she said to see if i could do a big smile like a joker smile and i can do that she also asked me to see if i can lift my left arm up i feel fine my lip is just numb on the left side

as far as medical history goes i have allergies i used to get sicksneezing coughing sore throat every year or more than once a year that toned down after getting help from the doctor when getting a physical at 17 or so i was told i had a heart murmur but thats all that was said on that
""
i do have a habit of staying up late and then not getting a full 78 hours of sleep i will say that this manifested in eye twitching my heart beating fast and headaches my eye twitching was something that concerned me so i started sleeping morethis actually started from playing a video game for 78 hours then it continued with my sleep issues my heart beating fast really concerned me and i started napping during the day because of this headaches basically started from staying up late to watch a show someone texting me so i stayed up speaking to them and then not being able to sleep i did talk to a doctor about this the eye twitching is a normal thing according to them they just told me to sleep more
""
one of my friends said this could be a symptom of dehydration i havent been drinking a lot of water lately i like water but i do not like drinking it if i havent had a meal yet some days i get my meals really late so most of the day could have gone by and i havent had anything to drink

i dont really have anything bad going on as far as i know what could cause this lip problem

i took a melatonin and texted my mum to ask whats up she said not to panic and asked if i wanted to go to the er i said it wasnt that bad and she told me to calm down
so i listed to guided meditation for 25 minutes which calmed me down significantly and didnt have any episodes during or after that i fell asleep about 2 am dreamt and woke up once at 5 before getting up at 1030 and i feel fine now

medical history short achilles tendons from august 2012 onwards poor mental health anxiety depression and ptsd from troubled childhood
""
sorry for the long story ive been struggling for years tldr following surgery to lengthen my achilles tendons i have been experiencing pain ever since and cant walk far or do strenuous activity why and what can i do
""
in 2012 i started having issues walking i tripped on the curb on my paper delivery job and was hit in the right ankle by a hockey stick later that day i then went into marching at sea cadets in the evening and thats when i realised i had a problem
""
i couldnt put my right heel down and it hurt a lot when i tried to force it went to the doc who told me it was torn ligaments and i chalked it up to the events that happened that day i injured my foot and skipped gym class for a few weeks i still dont know why my feet ended up this way
""
when it still wouldnt heal i went back to the docs and was then referred to so many different specialist and had x rays mris until they finally discovered my achilles tendon was short on my right foot it was only getting worse as i could only limp and walk on my toes everywhere they attempted casts to force my foot in place  no luck at all eventually we decided on surgery in 2013 november 4th i had my surgery and recuperated for 3 weeks finally my foot was flat again it felt so weird as it had been nearly 2 years since i walked flat
""
but then my left foot started playing up i couldnt put it down for the life of me and walked on my toes everywhere so next year october 31st 2014 i get my second surgery and the same happens i can walk flat on my feet again
""
however i cant walk anywhere far or do strenuous activity it really hurt to start doing pe again and i had to always sit out i couldnt partake in the scottish country dancing as my feet hurt so bad i could no longer walk far and always had to find somewhere to sit when out in town now i barely go out because walking and standing aches so much and i have lost a lot of jobs because of the struggle it feels like when you force your hand all the way back but i can still walk flat on my feet sometimes when someone accidentally taps or touches my calf it hurts intensely and i screamed out in shock even though ive just been sitting or laying stationary for hours
""
ive been seeing a physio for a few years who informed me my tendons are still a little tight though i can walk flat i do little stretches for my tendons but i dont feel a lot of help i dont think i will ever be able to walk far again i take nsaids meloxicam to help with the pain but it doesnt touch it at all i feel absolutely no relief i have tried every nsaid going i lost all my jobs and it was hell forcing myself to walk far
""
i got an ultrasound on my legs in 2017 and they discovered i had a little inflammation in my tendons but the orthopaedic surgeon said he wasnt concerned and sent me away this didnt answer any question though or solve my issue
""
why did i even end up like this why am i still experiencing a lot of pain and is there anything i can do to treat it that hasnt been mentioned might there be something else causing the pain should i seek out another specialist i considered maybe the nerves were damaged but ive no clue i dont know why anti inflammatories arent working im just desperate for relief and answers 
""
a bit unrelated but i get a lot of back pain when i go out walking too im not sure if this is related in any way ive never seen a doc for it and im not sure if the back pain is normal when just going on a walk or if it warrants a visit to the docs
""
if you read through all this thank you so much i really appreciate any advice you can offer

hello raskdocs i have been doing pull ups for around 2 years very consistently and recently ive experienced this chest pain right in between the pecs but very slightly leaning towards the right side which is especially aggravated when doing pullups especially near the top of the rom the pain started around two weeks ago and i sometimes feel it when i do very small motions like getting out of bed strangely enough i do not feel this pain at all while doing any sort of pushing motion pull ups and chin ups are also the only pulling motion i do so im not sure why this pain came if anyone has any recommendations on what to do especially because of the lockdown making medical treatment difficult it would be greatly appreciated i am around 54 115120 lbs asian and exercise very consistently for reference

so ive been experiencing mild throat irritation for 5 days or so it doesnt really hurt when i swallow it just feels irritated at times and it has kind of subsided the last couple of days and the pain moved mostly to my ears my ears are hurting a bit at the moment and its freaking me out its more like a feeling of pressure that sometimes travels to the back of my head than acute pain
""
obviously considering the circumstances i thought of covid but i dont seem to exhibit the main symptoms and i have been staying put for a few weeks now most of the time i get groceries delivered disinfect them wash my hands all that stuff so im inclined to rule that out
""
the reason i thought of allergies is because of the season it has been very warm and sunny where i live for the past weeks but then again i rarely leave the house and live on the third floor without a balcony or any exposure to outside beyond the windows soive also never really suffered from allergies in the past
""
im thinking of postnasal drip andor reflux because for a while now i started noticing a year ago but i think its been going on for longer ive been needing to clear my throat after eating especially when its certain foods in large quantities i also usually wake up with a stuffy nose and dry lips in the past few weeks before the sore throat and ear pain started ive felt the need to clear my throat even during the day outside of meals this was more of a dry cough rather than what i get after eating it basically felt like i had a lump does that sound consistent with pnd or lpr or gerd or any such things
""
other things to keep in mind
""
 for the past few weeks its been really warm in my house heating on at night  very large windows letting in the sun during the day i also wasnt letting in a lot of airflow the windows mostly stayed closed dont know what that does to the air quality but any tips are welcome should i get a humidifier open the windows more often
""
 ive always had bad anxiety and the current period has been hellish for me my brain is basically constantly looking for something to worry about the fact that im stuck at home by myself also means i fixate on the tiniest things my body does and im always on the lookout for symptoms i dont know if this changes anything but i thought i should mention it

sometimes my eyelid also feels very irritated as if there is something in my eye that i cant get out ive been prescribed different antibiotics that work a little bit or do nothing ive also been prescribed allergy eyedrops that do nothing if not make it worse the only time drops have helped is when they are the kind that have two antibiotics and a steroid polymyxin neomycin dexamethasone ive used these on and off for years now and they do help but once i run out the problem comes back after a while

hi i started feeling sharp pains in my stomach 7 weeks ago thought it was nothing too serious but came to realize it was gastritis from taking iron pills
""
i began treatment on 40mg omeprazole only last week am i still with acute gastritis or has it progressed to chronic
""
also what is the distinction between acute and chronic gastritis is it purely based on time a month or two how it started or is it judged on the cellular level
""
its very hard to find answers about that and im very worried i will have to live with discomfort because of my late treatment i read chronic is typically lifelong while acute can be cured

yesterday i was riding on a stationary bicycle about seven minutes into my workout i grabbed my chest as it felt like my heart was pounding about as large and heavily as it could it felt as though it was expanding to its full extremely uncomfortable capacity with each beat i was left breathless and a bit dizzy this all lasting about 6075 seconds in total when it went away i slowly kept riding to see if it would happen again but it never did

i ended up calling my doctor and he sent me in to get an ekg and a chest xray both coming back totally normal

they couldnt tell me what did happen but im honestly left still feeling a bit nervous about it im glad my tests came back fine but the incident really has me uneasy and i wish i knew more about what did actually happenif its likely to happen againsomething i have to be worried about

32 year old male nonsmoker

i had a large cyst on the center of my back for years over a month ago it became infected swelled up real big and i was in a lot of pain i went to an immediate care and they drained it doc said about 10 ounces poured out
""
i have been going for followup care regularly they were constantly packing it to keep it open flushing it with salineperoxide or we and dressing it it was basically a golfball sized void along my spine i must have been there 10 times the drainage has reduced and the wound has been healing nicely i finished antibiotics over three weeks ago and have had two cultures come back normalnegativelast one was two weeks ago
""
the wound had closed up several days ago and the serous liquid began leaking out of one of my pores near the original location of the cyst about an inch away from the wound closing i went to what i was hoping to be my final followup at the immediate care yesterday and the doc isnt overly concerned but wants to make sure everything is fine and referred me to a general surgeon
""
now i am freaking out a little here i went from thinking my body was healing according to plan and now there is a possibility that a surgery near my spine could be taking place thats terrifying to me today the wound did open back uptiny hole and the fluid came out there instead of the pore which i guess is better
""
could it just be such a large abscess that it is taking a long time to heal will they really perform surgery on me for this the liquid is watery sometimes clear sometimes more yellowish with some red not pussy there isnt a lot of it either

i woke up yesterday morning and noted that each time i burped id get a quick and sharp pain in the rightcenter of my chest wall  right side of my sternum area im burping a little more than usual so its happening with enough frequency to be concerning
""
additionally when i eat about 35 seconds after swallowing it assumedly passes this area and causes the same quick sharp pain
""
it isnt overwhelmingly painful but its alarming and concerning research ive done seems to indicate it could be an issue with my esophagus related to gerd which surprised me considering its so far down into my chest and on the rightcenter not the left where i would assume itd hurt moving toward the stomach
""
i do have a history of acid reflux issues that range from constant clearing of the throat after eating to excess burping but its never been considered super serious by any doctors i take pepcid ac to help a little
""
my concerns are obviously that its something serious but it came on so suddenly with everything going on currently it would be difficult to get in to see a gi can anyone give me some insight as to what my best options are right now and what it could be

i am 33f with no serious health problems however i do have chronic issues with fingernail deformity and while i have always treated it like a dermatological issue im wondering if there is another explanation since proper skincare doesnt make a difference
""
i do get flareups of eczema mainly on my hands and fingers but the nail deformities do not always correlate to a flareup nor do the prescription creams ive tried help the nails they do help the eczema
""
this problem has been occurring for at least 10 years and at any given time i have about half my nails affected although this one pictured is definitely the worst currently
""
sometimes the ridges are more like dimples in part of my nail sometimes they only run top to bottom sometimes side to side and as seen in this picture can be both with a lumpy and whitish appearance
""
there is no pain in addition to rx creams inteded to treat eczema one derm once prescribed an antifungal cream which didnt do anything to help either
""
for full disclosure the only other chronic issues i have are insomnia and i do frequently get vitamin d deficiencies and need to be put on rx strength my last reading was 4 i havent noticed any pattern against either of these issues with the nails though

maybe stayathome has left me too much time to notice and think about things

ive been noticing that meals seem to pass through me unusually quicklyive seen unmistakable telltale signs of meals id eaten only the night before or even just a few hours prior on their way out i looked it up online and it was saying full gi transit should take 2472 hours so this seems very anomalous prima facie
""
just curious why it might be so much shorter for me and what that might mean in terms of how to best manage my diet
26 f 150lbs ankylosing spondylitis with family history 511 white no drugs or drinking active 34 days a week
""
""
i want to preface this by saying i get why doctors are slowing down the doling out of prescription painkillers for patients but i have a serious condition ankylosing spondylitis and when i went to the doctors she basically gave me a lidocaine patch and told me to suck it up i was not asking for a year supply of painkillers i wasnt even asking for a month i asked for a week so i could catch up on sleep and make it to my next pt appointment my next appointment will consist of longer term repair and action and the possibility of a biological which i really dont want to do but i am assuming that is the nature of this beast
""
i understand the problem with abuse of painkillers but i am a serious patient and not a pill popper in fact i wait until my pain is so bad that i am crying to take 400mg of motrin
""
im a ft 85 worker getting 30 min1 hour of sleep can someone pls explain what i should do next or what i am missingnot seeing i genuinely want to understand 
""
any experience with this sort of situation is welcomed thank you very much

ive heard it could be a popped blood vessel but im really not sure she does suffer from hypertension and does take her meds when i took her blood pressure this morning it was 14493 she took her meds and i checked again this evening and it was 11783
""
she said that her eye is watery and itchy inside the eye but just now she said that the itch has gone but its still watery i have contacted a local doc and asked for her advice and if we should come in for a checkup were in lockdown in my country and can only travel within limits but she was busy today with patients back to back and hasnt responded yet
""
im really not sure if this is serious or not but i am really worried about her this is the first time my mum has experienced this so im not sure what to make of it
""
any clue on what this is is there anything i can do to alleviate this
""
any help is much appreciated thank you so much
for the past few days i have been feeling a nerve discomfort on the left side of my body especially at my joints my left knee thigh elbow shoulder left arm muscle left side of my head and even my left groin area
""
it doesnt hurt its more of a discomfort and it feels like its a nervous system issue but i am not sure my right side is totally normal and i dont feel that same thing i can still function normally day to day but just feel the bit of discomfort on the left another thing is that it feels relieving a bit to stretch out but the discomfort doesnt really go away
""
any idea what it could be and should i be concerned
""
i dont want to go to my doctors office if its something that isnt serious so that they can prioritize other people during this pandemic

any help is appreciated

husband 38m 215lbs no other health concerns
""
since the day i met him hes had an irregular heartbeat very fast arrhythmic and hard he says its been that way for as long as he can remember prior to meeting him 12 years ago he had an ekg done and the doctor said nothing looked alarming being a man he never thought about it again after leaving the office
""
fast forward to 2 months ago he went to get a tooth pulled and they took his bp it was alarmingly high so they called over a gp from the office next door to retake it turns out it wasnt a mistake his bp was 250140 this is the second time in 2 years that this same scenario has happened the same numbers both time we were immediately sent to the emergency room
""
at the er they retook his bp and did an ekg the doctor asked him how he felt any dizziness numbness nausea nope never ekg came back normal kidney and heart function were normal potassium levels were the only thing off it came back low apparently hes been walking around for years with a stroke level blood pressure we left with a packet of papers and a prescription for lisinoprilhctz 10125mg
""
the packet of papers had a list of conditions that cause secondary hypertension i googled each one and the only one that explained the chronic hypertension the low potassium and the heart arrhythmia was hyperaldosteronism
""
we live in the usa own our own business and dont have the ability to afford health insurance because of this his hypertension is once again uncontrolled that and the covid pandemic is preventing us from from seeking a gp to refer us to a specialist to have the tests done to find out if its primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism unilateral or bilateral or a different condition altogether
""
questions does my deduction of hyperaldosteronism sound likely
""
we have been doing intermittent fasting for a few days and im curious about the risks for him is there any science on the subject of hyperaldosteronism and fasting if so please link
""
also how can we get him a refill on his prescription without putting him at risk of catching the covid19 virus

basically in august 2018 i had what i thought was food poisoning but ive just had another episode which is following the exact same course now im not sure and think it could be an ongoing issue but the time between each one makes it unlikely surely
""
both times i woke up and stomach just felt off which gradually turned to vomiting and severe pains both cramps and very tender to the touch both times the vomiting and cramps lasted less than 18 hours but the severe tenderness lasted days afterwards the tenderness is kind of all over but noticeably worse around belly button and to the right the same as last time
""
i can tense and flex abdominal muscles and dont feel any pain but even slight pressure hurts so i dont think its muscular
""
i had no fever or diarrhea either time but i could not keep anything down even a mouthful of water would increase the stomach pains then lead to vomiting not long after
""
ampx200b
""
now i didnt notice this last time but this time yesterday the first vomit i did was full of these translucent chunks thats the best way i can describe it they were like chunks of clear jelly but more firm and they came up with barely any liquid i picked a few out of the sink and rinsed them because i had never seen or heard of anything like it and i have googled it and still cant find anything they were solidly formed so i dont see how it could be mucus the chunks varied in size from probably a few millimetres to a few centimetres i hadnt eaten anything since the night before

just to give a little rundown
""
last week i had fairly sudden onset lower abdominal pain it first felt like creeping period cramps which soon turned into intense pain at one point it got so painful i couldnt move without cringing the pain slowly subsided and i was feeling much better 3040 mins of the whole shebang i was able to get a visit w my ob the next day and after an ultrasound they confirmed i had a recentlyruptured cyst
""
i also had an iud mirena and after discussing options w my doctor i decided to get it removed being that it could have been the cause of my cyst i also decided id try going back to the pill and am on my 5th day of aviane
""
my doctor also mentioned that i had what appeared to be somewhat polycystic ovaries but the largest by far had been the one that ruptured i didnt have many questions at the time but after researching a bit im curious if im in the beginning stages of pcos
""
i hope that the pill will help to minimize these amp future cysts but i guess time will tell it may also be important to note that my mom has pcos so i know this is present in my immediate family

49m 60 197lbs never smoker social drinker with some chronic neck and back pain from an old motorcycle injury ive had this problem for years where in particular when my pain is ramped up i have restricted flow and trouble finishing peeing by that i mean i have to sit there forever and it feels restricted it started around the time all my neck issues started so i always associated it with it ive tried several of the various prostate type pills both over the counter and prescription and they have had mild effect but dont last
now heres the strange part i came down with what was likely covid a little over a month ago and the entire time i had symptoms which were horrible btw i could pee perfectly normal it was the one good thing that came from that sickness as soon as my symptoms started to fade 27 days later the restricted flow curse came back does that make anyone think of something i and my docs have missed
medications none since about half way through my covid experience to current

thank you for reading my post
im white primary complaint is severe thinking issues and brain fog since ive been a kid not on any medications was on like 8 medications over the years many years ago can only remember prozac cant remember the names of the other ones but this problem has existed long before i took medication i have a history of lower back problems if it matters herniated disc
""
since ive been young i have had a weird mind i had an alcoholic emotionally abusive mother she crashed with me in the car when i was like 11 years old she threw a clock at my head wed come home sometimes and shed be in the yard all fucked up on pain meds or on the couch half asleep or screaming or whatever nightmare shed create for us to come home to i was constantly scared from 912 as this happened woke up to her dead on the floor when i was 12 all i felt was relief i am trying to figure out what is wrong with my brain
""
ever since ive been around 10 my mind has felt very foggy and like theres a constant noise in my head a silent noise an invisible hurricane like 10000 constant thoughts or something pulling me in every direction like madness i cant hold a job because of it i cant act normal i have rage issues i failed school after getting terrible grades for years because every paper i looked at i couldnt concentrate because its like my brain cant think due to the invisible hurricane and silent tornado alarm combined with severe brain fog i have been tested for adhd but i dont have it ive seen like 8 therapists all useless been on 8 different meds for ocd depression and anxiety all useless
""
the strangest thing is that rarely only maybe twenty times in my life i have woken up with less brain fog more ability to connect to people to understand the way someones talking to me to think more intelligently its like my anxiety and ocd dissapear i feel happy and then after a few minutes im back to being all messed up sometimes i have a more minor version of this clarity and goodness that lasts up to a half an hour and slowly diminishes through out the hour i used to slam my head into things as a kid if that could be effecting me maybe i have a herniated disc in my neck or some tight nerves or something screwing up my brain i have no idea does anyone have any advice psychiatrists and doctors have all been completely useless all those meds did was give me nightmares or make my ocd worse or make me feel nauseous thanks
so yesterday my friend pointed out to me that i have this weird bump that was formed behind my left ear i had no clue as its not visible to me and i feel no pain when touching it the bump is firm to the touch and the best way i can describe its almost like its glued to the bone  unmovable and doesnt feel like a pimple
""
the only thing that i have done to my ear recently is i used some ear drops to get some excess earwax out but that was done a month ago so i doubt thats the culprit i dont feel any symptoms of any sort of cold no weakness fatigue nothing
""
im a healthy 20yo male not on any medications and have no existing medical issues
""
me being a hypochondriac i did some research online and have come to some conclusions it seems as there is an enlarged posterior auricular lymph node which could be caused by many things it could also be a boilpimple but not sure just a bit concerned as this could be early signs of lymphoma
""
not sure of my next steps should i wait a week or two and see if it goes away or should i visit a doctor

26m  i have approximately 90bpm at rest i know its considered normal but i read that heart has a sort of maximum beats in one life i know that its not a mathematical law for example a person with 60bpm wont live always 15x years longer than a person that has 90bpm but how much bpm can influence life expectation
""
also i want to ask some suggestion to lower my rest bpm even if 90 is considered normal i think its better if i lower it a bit im already aware about physical excercise but maybe there are other things i can add to that

history of twitching and symptoms
""
may 2019 left hand locked up whole moving along with entire arms stuck bent only time cramping as this has happened also while hiking i grabbed a vine and tried to pull myself up a couple of weeks later i couldnt but felt like i tore something in trying had no idea of any issues at this point besides random hand cramp doctor chalked up to dehydration and over fatigue
""
late june i woke up and right thigh felt like it had been bruised and stiff it started twitching after a couple of days and was annoying to walk with but went away two weeks later then in midjuly my right calf started twitching noticed while fishing and that it twitched more upon use the right calf then felt tight for over a month after including hiking during the honeymoon and would twitch often i had a few cramps over summer but not many mainly my hand cramped a few times and got stuck back in may and thats when i googled and saw  a mistake weve all made to get here often
""
midaugust my right calf felt better as did the whole right leg to present mid august the left calf starts twitching and feeling odd its felt odd to this day and twitches most days on and off especially at night
""
early september my left arm started to feel odd noticed it while clapping fight song at a football game and its felt easily fatigued ever since at times it will twitch with big thumpers generally a couple of times a day sometimes not at all use or flexing can aggravate it my left hand also felt stiff at times but works fine no hand cramps since may only a few cramps in calves randomly since
""
october my chest area there felt tight and weird breathing at times so to be safe doc ordered a ct scan with contrast and it came back normal no mention of that lung thing in may noted the tightness left late october
""
november to present back pain with twitching and stiffness left arm feeling fatigued and bicep area twitching left side chest hurts to sleep on and left arm seems like its less full noticed a soft spot in my chest below left pec that is weird to sleep on and that my left arm seems to be shrinking some and so went to pcp again this past week she felt the spots and said very odd and recommended i point it out to neurologist on next visit he wasnt impressed in march visit
""
neuro visits
""
visit 1 emgncv i had an emgncv in october after pcp saw the twitching in august and ordered it for peace of mind ill attach that a little odd but nothing sinister seen the weird part was how much i jolted and moved during nerve shocking part to the point the tech was concerned and left the room to talk to the doc going to do the emg he made note of that during the report i think he skipped the muapsmup part though with the needle as afterward talking to a friend that had it they had him flex or press muscles with the needle in and although they stuck me in many places they didnt do that with the needle in after this testingresults i was a bit calmer but twitching random spots kept happening and left arm still fatigued the guy who performed it was a physical medicine amp rehabilitation doctor at a local hospital chain
""
visit 2 neuro 1 clinicalin december i met with a new neuro for a full clinical he hardly saw any twitching and put me through full workup i also pointed out a weird spot on my left arm like a little dent dominant arm and he didnt seem interested he mentioned bfs and ordered an aldolase and ck blood test he said assuming no issues there no follow up needed his only concern was high left side reflexes he said arm fatigue could be from bfs and sent me on my way bloodwork came back normal
""
visit 3 neuro 2 and short clinical i had another neuro set for january they tried many places due to waiting time and went and he did a short clinical didnt see much twitching said reflexes a little high but wasnt sure he ordered similar ck and full blood cbcb12 blood tests and neckspine mri i followed up with him in march two months later mri showed arthritis in back and minor spinal stuff the bloodwork was fine i still havent been able to find out more about arthritis which seems odd at my age he said none of this would cause the twitching
""
visit 4 neuro 3 short clinicalvisited the neuro i was scheduled to see originally he said it was odd my muscles seemed less on one side but didnt think atrophy put me through some tests and seemed annoyed i was there after the other visits until i explained this had been scheduled the prior august he ordered a myasthenia gravis test and that came back normal and not the cause he said i could seek a bigger hospital opinion or just accept its benign as he thinks
""
pcp visits had multiple cbc tests run throughout this and magnesium heavy metal and the only thing ever found was low iron in august 2019 they did scope upper and lower and found nothing besides small hiatal hernia and little acid reflux chalked up low iron to blood donations but it doesnt line up
""
lyme doctor visit visited a lyme doctor and he said it was likely lyme he gave me a prescription for doxy and i took it for 3 weeks and no help i got freaked out as he said if it was  if it could make it worse didnt follow up as the pcp ordered a lyme test that came back negative the only thing that makes me wonder is this link httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4443866httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc4443866
""
things i can still do these things have me thinking its more likely bfs i can still type 70 words a minute no dropping falling or grip issues i have walked 10000  steps a day every day the last three months i can do pullups and chinups and flips on gym bars and hold my weight even upside down i went bowling and played catch with a football without issues the only problem is that twitching happened a ton on my left side after after sitting my back seizes up some and twitches none of my twitches have ever remained constant though hotspots in the left calf and left arm bicep and back ive had ones on the right side too such as the forearm eye and thigh xanax helped some for short times then pains and twitches come back i was never really anxious before this whole thing
""
next visiting a larger hospital chain at a respected university neurology facility on june 11th was scheduled for april originally and assuming not canceled due to virus this was suggested and passed on via my pcp

medicine tried gerd ppi and omerprazle this all started two weeks after taking the medicine and finishing it xanax tylenol alieve iceheat patches also been taking daily multivitamin and magnesium i also tried a chiropractor

my feared questions with things are still feel free to be blunt or ask further questions

why high reflexes on one side isnt that a bad sign left thigh has twitched now for a week straight
""
why twitching and pain plus arm fatigue leftarm still and seems more loose skin wise and looks dented between bicepelbow area
""
back is burning and hurts to sit feels mostly fine standing why is sleeping so bad and stiffness worse when waking up
""
annoyed nobody will straight up give a diagnosis outside of possibly bfs never was an anxious person before this
""
scared of  i realize its not one to get via the internet but appreciate thoughts or input the things that calm me are the time that has passed and seeing multiple opinions say likely benign but i dont physically feel better if anything worse

google leads me to believe it might be a burst blood vessel but all of the causes listed for the burst vessel dont apply to me it literally appeared one day without me noticing while working from home with no instigating event and has lasted for almost two weeks webmd also says that burst blood vessels should heal in two weeks or less there is no pain when i push down on it

the first time i got a uti was a few months after i started having sex at 18 it would pop back up occasionally over the next couple of years recently ive had around 5 utis in the last couple of months and it happens after sex even when i pee however sometimes it just randomly shows up again without sex the last time i had a uti i went on antibiotics and it cleared up just fine then 4 days later today i woke up and it hurt to pee the weird thing is that i went to the doctor and had them double check my urine to make sure i didnt have any more bacteria the day i finished my antibiotics so im wondering if this is an antibioticresistant uti or if my lab results were clean immediately following my antibiotics is this a new uti doesnt antibioticresistant mean it never went away in the first place
""
tdrl uti came back after my urine test was clean
this is for my wife 29f 57 160lbs she takes wellbutrin xl 150mg and has pcos
""
she took half a hit of lsd this past saturday had a good experience with visuals which she didnt expect due to the small dose but since then todays tuesday has had a crippling hangover effect of tiredness depression inability to focus and lack of motivation it doesnt seem to have gotten any better over time yet although of course 3 days isnt much of a sample size since saturday her sleep is better than before if anything her depression historically does seem dopaminergic in nature meaning that ssris and serotonin precursors like tryptophan generally make her more depressed whereas dopaminergic agents generally improve her mental state
""
my best guess currently is that lsd  wellbutrin massively downregulated her dopamine receptors if thats true the best treatment i know of beyond just time is magnesium to help upregulate and ltyrosine to make sure she can manufacture extra dopamine however id love to know if anyone has other  more precise takes or better ideas for treatment

just got a cat scan done on my throat today in order to complete this scan they injected contrast in me and this was my first time they did say i may feel nauseous or warm in some areas maybe a little taste in the mouth or the urge to pee but during the scan i did feel the warmth and the urge to pee as well as another symptom that i was not expecting i felt a bit of a shortness of breath and an increased heart rate like adrenaline was released i did let the technician know about these symptoms he did say it was normal to have a reaction for the first time being exposed to this substance as long as it was not a allergic reaction this did not last long after the scan was completed

has anyone experienced something like this with contrast

id describe it as stabbing headaches it was focused on my right temple it came in waves for hours each wave felt like a minute long i took advil the 2nd time but it still recurred
""
other symptoms
 massive eyestrain but also i am working from home and am facing screens most of the time

 fatigue
 trouble sleeping i am sleepy the entire day get to bed by 12 mn but i fall asleep at almost 4 am i can be in bed for hours with my eyes closed and not fall asleep
 this happened one time last march 3 but might be worth noting there was a sharp shooting pain on my left foot just through a vein at the bottom of my feet then it went through my toes and my toe in voluntarily curled up
 ill be honest these days i feel like my standard status is having a headache not as bad as the ones i narrated above but in some form i always have it im not that worried cos this might be because i cant get enough sleep and anxiety caused by the pandemic  my work as it pretends that the world isnt falling apart haha

thats all i can remember for now

i tried to seek a doctors help but the hospital in my city has no neuro that takes my health insurance and due to covid i cannot go elsewhere as we have no public transpo and city boundaries are closed

21 year old male no underlying medical conditions

mind you my eyes have always caused me problems i have 2020 vision but about 2 years ago i had cellulitis in my eye that was pretty bad but it cleared up very quick after a visit to the doctor i used to also have ocular migraines i havent had one in probably 4 years tho
""
anyway my problem now is for about the last 4 days the vision in my left eye has beenweird its hard explain looks like theres some blurriness in the corner of my eye but when i blink and open my eyes big it goes away for a bit like my eyelashes are sticking together there is a tiny ache but that might be from me rubbing or just eye strain in general ive occasionally had these aches without blurriness and when i got a cat scan 2 years ago they didnt find anything abnormal besides the cellulitis i had my eyes are usually pretty dry as well ive just never had all these symptoms at once ive done the test where i put my finger in front of my eye and move it up down left and right and theres no pain just thought id get some advice thanks
26 year old male 62 183lbs duration almost two months symptoms i started noticing an issue with my ear roughly 2 or 25 months ago i went for a trail run and when i came home and started stretching i had a weird whooshing in my right ear once i bent down and my ear became extremely clogged it took probably 2 or 3 days for my ear to open up again and then the tinnitus set in ive pretty much had unilateral tinnitus on and off since then but for the past month its been pretty constant this led to an ent and audiology appointment which showed a hearing discrepancy not actual clinical hearing loss though but borderline my ent couldnt find anything wrong but ordered an mri even though he said it was extremely unlikely to be an acoustic neuroma
""
ive posted on here before about acoustic neuroma and finally had an mri done my ent agreed that i could forego the contrast on the mri due to my concerns about gadolinium both the radiologist and my ent couldnt find anything suspicious on my mri im aware that theres a small risk that a smaller acoustic neuroma could have been overlooked im having another audiology exam done in 5 or 6 months and if that shows a new decline in my hearing then ill get an mri with contrast kind of feel like thats unlikely though
""
assuming that nothing was missed on the mri could my issue just be caused by anxiety or have no explanation i do suffer from pretty severe health anxiety but it seems odd that the ringing would just be in my right ear my ear also pops when i like yawn and theres a feeling of pressure could this be related to my tmd or even like eustachian tube dysfunction
""
thanks for all the advice ive gotten on here i really appreciate it

i started a 28day course of trimethoprim for suspected prostratitis 8 days ago i cant get any tests done at the moment because of the cvirus
""
gradually over the week ive had increased discomfort and bloating in my stomach headache constiptation and dry mouth and eyes due to the antibiotics i phoned a doctor this morning about symptoms and was told since ive taken at least 7 days of antibiotics i can stop which is the guidence for a standard uti
""
the nice national institute for health and care excellence recommends 14 days for prostratitis review and then a possible additional 14 days after tests httpscksniceorgukprostatitisacutescenariohttpscksniceorgukprostatitisacutescenario

ive now got 3 different paths with this my instinct is that if it is prostratitis i should just try and take a 14 day course and stop my stomach was not right prior to this  i tested positive for hpylori about 6 months ago and have been taking omeprazole for stomache discomfort

there accusations of being a crackpot should be put aside i hope

but im curious if anyone notices an increase in anxiety and overall body tension after using fluoride in any formulation  stannous fluoride sodium fluoride acidulated phosphate fluoride etc not drinking it but using it per label instructions our water supply is not fluoridated where i live so i believe my overall intake is limited to my intentional use

but when i use fluoride toothpastes and mouthwashes within 45 minutes i get overall increased anxiety and body tension the elevated anxiety symptoms last nearly a day as a test i switched to a nonfluoride toothpaste from toms of maine still need to bush right

previous issues with low mood anxiety panic attacks and disordered eating

when ive experienced low mood in the past ive found myself staring at the ceiling for 20 minutes without realising how long id done it for a kind of mild dissociation however ive noticed myself doing this more recently for example today i was leaning on my window sill singing to myself and when i eventually snapped out of it my arms hurt pretty bad from leaning my whole body weight on my elbows like that but i didnt realise any pain before coming to i also felt like i almost couldnt move as if the leaning and the singing werent in my control  like my body was doing it and i wasnt and i was just in my body in between these moments of dissociation i feel all sleepy and woozy my vision goes out of focus too i feel almost as if im going into myself
""
whats gotten me really worried now is something i did just before i was in the shower washing my hair and suddenly i grabbed a handful of hair and pulled it hard i dont think i did this i mean i suppose i mustve but i didnt consciously move my arm to do this in my mind i was screaming to let go but my arm continued pulling my hair for a good 15 seconds before it stopped pulling

this is all getting me very worried so if someone could help me out in any way i would very much appreciate it thank you redditors lt3

so i have a weird question regarding this whole zantac thing so i was taking zantac while in the desert for a training exercise for the military my meds were in the shade of a truck but im sure since outside temps were well over 100 my meds definitely got hot as well  the question i have is ive read that the ndma is worse in zantac while its hot while i was there i had two bouts of horrible abdominal pain and i went to the hospital they told me i had a fatty liver well i was reading that high ndma exposure the symptoms are abdominal pain i got a ultrasound about a year after they occurqnce to check and its still diffusuly echogenic and mildly enlarged so what if its fibrosis and not stetosis or whatever i guess i might be freaking out over a coincidence but figured id ask

about a month and a half ago i was at the gym and felt my heart start racing and thought i was going to pass out i didnt but ended up going to the hospital got some test everything was ok it happened again two days later and everything was fine again but and this is what is still bugging me my troponin was 005 i get send one more time to the hospital after feeling light headed at a clinic and both other times my troponin was 002 but i might have taken biotin within a 24 hours of the last one and 24 of the first 002 test results

doc said its probably anxiety i agree but how much does biotin mess up these results

main issue persistent knee pain below patella

length 78 months

existing issues none
""
current meds none

i used to weightlift a decent amount 4 times a week there was one day when i went in to squat and it was just too painful to finish my workouts i havent worked out in a gym in probably 5 months now but the pain has not subsided
""
i mainly notice it when i bear any sort of load on my legs most noticeably walking up stairs is when i get reminded of my crappy knee its not an extreme amount of pain however its definitely uncomfortable and i try to stop whatever im doing when i notice it
""
what it could be from i went rock climbing around 78ish months ago yeah coincidentally around the time that my knee pain started i took a fall of 710 feet and slammed my knee against the rock face i was pretty much out of commission for the day and ever since theres been a persistent pain however i could walk fine and as stated earlier really only noticeable when i bear weight with my knees
""
that being said i read that it could be patellar tendonitis im just looking to get second opinions before i go to the doc just due to the situation with covid19
""
i appreciate any help or advice
19 years old male 183cm60 height 90kg200pounds weight a good portion of my weight is due to muscle however im classified as overweight i have high cholesterol but just on the upper limit nothing too bad diabetes and hypertension runs in my family though mild usually eating well and balanced 3week gym sessions with weight training and cardio couldnt go to the gym for the past month due to covid19
""
my issue i started to shake internally nothing could be seen or felt by someone that touches the body part that i think that shakes it feels like a mild earthquake is happening while nothing is actually moving the tremors usually happens inside my limbsmostly hands and legs sometimes goes up to my torso and my lower back this didnt bother me at first but while i was trying to sleep it got to a point that i couldnt focus on sleeping it didnt go away as i predicted and it regularly happens during the day and night i can not understand or predict what might have caused this
""
of course i googled the symptoms and it said people who have parkinsons or ms have this symptom or it is caused by stress im not too stressed although having a blurry vision about the future kind of stresses me out due to covid19 i manage it and dont feel stressed during my day to day activities

thank you for spending your time and helping much appreciated

med history migraine wo aura posterior vitreous detachment posterior spinal fusion from scoliosis t5l3 depression wellcontrolled currently taking zoloft 50 mg
""
two weeks ago i experienced what i believe to be my first migraine aura ive had migraines in the past but never with aura with the pandemic ongoing i spoke with a doctor via teleconference after describing the aura he said it seemed to fit the description of something called scintillating scotoma i have a history of posterior vitreous detachment but because i experienced positive visual symptoms with a gradual march he didnt believe it to be a sign of retinal detachment he also said stroke was unlikely due to my age not having a history high blood pressure and lack of other symptoms such as weakness and speech issues the aura was followed by a headache but not one id describe as a typical painful migraine
""
since that event two weeks ago ive had a headache nearly every day the severity waxes and wanes and the headaches are present at different times of day  sometimes they develop later in the day and sometimes theyre present in the morning ive also been experiencing some feelings of vertigo ive been working from home due to the pandemic and spending a lot of time on the computer so i adjusted the color and brightness of my computer display to reduce glare and have been taking screen breaks at regular intervals ive also been making sure to exercise regularly get enough sleep and eat foods rich in vitamins and magnesium nothing seems to be helping
""
im by no means asking for a diagnosis online but i would like to know if this sounds like something worth making an appointment to see my doctor in person with everything going on regarding covid19 im hesitant to make a doctors appointment unless its truly necessary thank you for any and all help

hey 19yo female 54 ft 137lb white venezuelan i dont smoke i dont drink alcohol and i dont use recreational drugs also i dont have any medical history of importance and i dont take any meds
""
as the title says my heart has been skipping a beat quite frequently its been months since the first time i noticed it was recurrent i dont have any pain when it occurs and i dont feel dizzy is just a sensation in my chest just between my boobs specifically that forces me to cough and a second later when i cough i dont have it anymore i already see a doctor the past december and he told me that probably i was stressed or maybe i have anxiety he prescribed me sublingual pills called neurexan composition passiflora incarnata d2 06 mg avena sativa d2 06 mg coffea arabica d12 06 mg zincum isovalerianicum d4 06 mg excipients magnesium stearate lactose and told me to take them for 3 months i did as prescribed and despite feeling a little better i keep having issues whit the same feeling in my chest
""
ive tried to track the sensation but it really just happens suddenly ive noticed it happens more after i eat so i have been thinking the issue is in my stomach or something like that but i dont have a clue i havent changed the way i eat or the things i eat and my diet is overall healthy
""
this worries me because i think is too recurrent to be just a thing that happens and because i tend to worry a lot when it comes to disease and health even if its nothing i overthink it also one of my grandmothers died of a heart attack at 75yo and my other grandmother has hypertension and diabetes shes taking meds for that so i think i have a certain genetic when it comes to the heart but im not sure about this i dont know much about genetics and stuff
""
anyways any advice you guys can offer me thank you for your time
im 17f three months ago i was wearing toosmall shoes and felt something shift or pop in my right knee while walking up stairs i couldnt walk for like an hour the pain subsided and i was able to walk with a limp sometimes my knee would just completely give out but thats stopped happening ive rested a lot more recently but the pain is just getting worse im limping still and it hurts so much to walk and even while im just standing or sitting its really stiff even when it doesnt hurt and i cant do much to strengthen it because it hurts when i bend it and pops when i bend it past 90 degrees

i dont have loose joints i just went in and got xrays and my bone structure and alignment is fine the doc said to do physical therapy for a bit and come back ill give it a try but its so bad and i dont know what to do

issue youre having be as detailed as possible  so at some point in 20132014 or so i randomly developed folliculitis of the scalp ive seen a doctor and dermatologist about it and they basically just said theres no way to get rid of it heres some medicine to make it not as bad its 7 years later and ive been taking sulfatrim every single day since then and i still very often get bad flareups on my scalp ive tried various shampoos head and shoulders seems to irritate my scalp the least but doesnt really help with the issue and cleansers and none have really worked all that well
""
so i guess my questions are is this really something ill have to just deal with for the rest of my life is there no avenue i can pursue to try and get this solved for good are there any home remedies anybody can recommend to at least minimize the outbreaks and give me some sort of relief
""
since were in quarantine and all i figured id shave my hair really short so i could get some good pictures of my scalp and maybe work a little harder to get rid of it currently attempting some acne cream with salicylic acid in it even though this isnt technically acne as far as i understand it and some polysporin trying them both on opposite sides of my head to see if one works better than the other i will be trying to use a different towel every time i shower to dry my head use a different pillow case every night and try my absolute darndest not to touch my scalp and scratch it even though its almost constantly itchy as hell
""
here is an album of pictures of my scalp httpsimgurcoma9ysw0cnhttpsimgurcoma9ysw0cn

i would really really like to try and get this to be less of an issue than it currently is and i hope somebody here can help me out i would super appreciate it

i was feeling very dizzy and tired lately for last three weeks and when i googled up i saw that anemia could cause it chest pain cold hands and legs dizziness weakness my lips are chapped and my skin is very drymy skin has been dry for last 2 years tho the symptoms matched i used to have anemia 2 years ago and i got treatment and my blood levels got normal
""
i have heavy periods and eat little meat so i thought i was having anemia again
""
i got my periods and i thought i should take iron pills because im loosing a lot of blood
""
i took 1 pill everyday in evening for 6 days when i was having periods
""
the medication i took is called sorbifer durules which has 320mg of iron sulfate equivalent to 100mg of iron also it has 60mg of vitamin c
""
so i took 6 pills in total in 6 days
""
after my periods end they ended yesterday i realized i was having metallic taste in my mouth and got worried i got extremely anxious and had panic attack while telling my parents about the pill i took i was crying and panicking so my parents didnt take it seriously i know it was illogical to take iron supplement pills without consulting doctor and without checking my blood hemoglobin levels and im very scared now

lost most of the peripheral vision in th left sore eye and double vision and blind spotsblack spots in that eye

numbness in hands and face
extreme pain in the back of my head and neck
my occipital nerves at time feel like they are on fire
i drop everything have issues walking

im extremely sensitive to the light and sun
my migraines have ramped up used to average 2 to 3 a month now its 2 to 3 a week and theyve changed
ive also developed some kind of tremor in my arm
""
so the new issue i wanted to get in the pool the other day because its so hot here right now but i knew the sun would hurt i made a patch to put over my glasses to block it but when i did i could tell that eye was pointing inwards towards my nose when i close my right eye the good one my left eye just darts in stays pinned in the corner by my nose
""
ive seen so many doctors all except a neurologist ive been fighting for that for a year
""

bf started having fever 417 bouncing between 100102f all week with a mild headache until er trip 426 when his fever spiked to 104f and he had sore throat lack of appetite and vomiting in addition to the fever and headache he was tested for covid19 results came back that he doesnt have it doesnt have strep either he did have pneumonia and has been taking antibiotics since yesterday it hurts to swallow and he cant speak without it sounding like he has marbles in his mouth
""
when he lays down to sleep he snores with very nasty gurgling sounds like theres fluid stuck between his mouth and chest
""
not only does it hurt to swallow he has a lack of appetite and the lack of food is contributing to his late night anxiety
""
during the day he can breathe fine and keep food down at night he claims the fluid impedes his ability to sleep
""
idk what else can be done if we do go back to the er hes already on antibiotics and his ability to breathe has been the same

i have a hard irritable mildly painful to touch lumpcyst in the tip of my right earlobe which has so far been benign ive had this for about a year in total which recurs every 2 or more months staying for about 12 weeks per recurrence then disappearing again it so far seems benign but im concerned it could be an indication of something more severe but im not sure what that might be
""
more embarrassingly ive also rarely experienced pain in gtmy left testiclelt which has been occurring for about 23 years it has occurred more frequently during my work hours which involves physical labour appearing suddenly and very painful it stays for between 15 hours but disappears as quickly as it arrives always being gone by the end of the day

if anyone could provide answers or advice to either problems it would be much appreciated i hope ive given enough information

my habit is pretty minor but i will still go into withdrawals if i stop im trying to figure out what will be harder on my immune system continuing with a maintenance dose of heroin just enough to keep me from being sick or to go through withdrawals any feedback would be greatly appreciated i just want to do whats best for my immune system right now
""
some other info i just started feeling symptoms today and im a 26 year old male
i 22f usually get my feet done regularly and they usually clip my toenails there but now that were in quarantine i tried to do it myself and cut my toenail too short im pretty sure it was an ingrown toenail because i was having some irritation on the right side of my toe so i took it out with tweezers but now i think its infected i have a throbbing pain in the toe and there is some redness and swelling so thats what makes me think its infected i really dont want to go to the doctor unless i have to but i will if i need to if someone could please tell me if its infected and what to do or if i should see a doctor i would really appreciate it thanks in advance

hello all  i would appreciate any insights from a doctor on this issue
""
my brother suddenly passed away last july without us knowing about any preexisting conditions other than being hard of hearing which does run in the family given that i am his sister and only a year younger than him im 22f ive been very concerned about any possibility of him having a genetic condition that i might have too we finally got his autopsy report in today and it said they found the following
""
 cerebral heterotopic gray matter foci  brain malformation they believe he had a seizure as a result of this that caused his passing  also some brain edema apparently he had a lack of purkinje cells
 marfanoid body habitus there is no history of marfans within the family that we know of and i am also not displaying any of the typical signs that i can tell  but he was skinny and tall had long arms and fingers etc
 chronic hepatic congestion
 splenomegaly
 all toxicology results came back negative
""
if anyone has any insights on which of these conditions if any i should be tested for i would greatly appreciate it i did undergo some testing on my heart last year since at the time we were still suspecting it may have been a heart issue ive had 2 ekgs and an echocardiogram neither of which were very remarkable i had blood testing with elevated ast amp alt levels but upon secondary testing 2 weeks later came back normal

thank you so much for any help  this has been terrible on my anxiety and as someone who deals with hypochondria has been incredibly stressing and upsetting

my dad was diagnosed with nonhodgkins lymphoma grade 2 few months ago in the beginning he used to get injected every 3 weeks for the first eight injections after the first six he now gets injected with ristovarituximab every three months for two years he got a pet ct done after the fifth chemo injection and the scan was all clear
""
his 3rd injection which he gets every 3 months is now due i read that rituximab represses the immune system and works by blocking the immune cells
""
would it be wise to get the treatment done right now when the immune system is extremely important  on the contrary would it be wise to delay the injection because there could be a risk of recurrence
""
the oncologist thats looking after my dad told him that ristovarituximab helps the body improve the immune system but thats not what i found out im in no way saying that i know more about the said medicine than a medical professional im just stating every thing i know to give you the clearest picture possible thank you

of slight note i have lost 10 pounds in the past month due to increased physical activity i walk about seven miles a day for my job and i have inadvertently started intermittent fasting since my workload is so high i rarely have time to eat in the job im not particularly concerned about this but figure its good to mention since its happening at the same time as this issue which ill detail now
""
i posted about this a little over a month ago but theres been some recent developments that are concerning me
""
for nearly two months now i have been dealing with a tingly surface level numbness in the middle of my back on the left side its not constant but it happens every day for several hours a day applying pressure to the affected area will fix the feeling briefly but it comes back in a matter of minutes
""
a couple weeks ago the tingle spread higher up my back into the shoulder blade area and doubled down on the intensity sometimes it feels deeper into the actual muscle rather than just surface level now
""
as of yesterday the same tingle started in my left calf down to my ankle i didnt lose my ability to move but i was noticeably clumsier this numbness was constant for most of yesterday and all through the night but has gone away upon waking up this morning
""
aaaand as of thirty minutes ago the tingle started in my left hand specifically affecting my ring and pinky finger and palm area directly below them
""
applying pressure to my hand and leg does not have the same fix that my back does unfortunately admittedly im extremely panicked over this and i called out of work today to see if a day of bed rest will help im pretty upset that all thats happened is another body part falling numb
""
i feel this is something i need to physically go to the doctors office to address which im not entirely willing to do right now since my loved ones are very high risk that being said ill absolutely make arrangements if this seems like an urgent matter i have left a voice message for my pcp so we can try and schedule a video chat to discuss this further but who knows when that will come to fruition given current events any insight from this subreddit would be wholly appreciated
sorry in advance for the nature of this issue this probably isnt a big deal but im just really confused i had a weird experience when i ejaculated just a little bit ago i didnt really feel as if i was about to finish but all of a sudden i felt a strange pain and then looked down and did see a bit of ejaculate had just come out the pain was a sharp stinging kind of pain at a particular point within the head of my penis specifically somewhere above the urethra and a little left of center i tried massaging the area to see if the pain was still there and it consistently comes back if i do basically anything that would give me an erection i also noticed above that area there appeared to be a small ridge in the heads skin im circumcised if thats relevant its not discolored or particularly abnormal it looks like the natural ridges there but just noticeably a little thicker i dont think ive noticed it before ever but i cant say for certain i dont really want to post a photo for obvious reasons but thats the best i can describe it ive never experienced pain during ejaculation before or pain specifically like this at all i also havent had sex for several months so i dont think it would be an infection especially with how it perfectly coincided with the ejaculate ive also never had an std or any particular sexual health issues before as far as i know

i realize how dumb this sounds but is it possible that i like blocked the urethra or something and caused some ejaculate to burst into my penis i just cant fathom what this would be and wanna know if anybody has experienced or heard of it before
now normally i would immediately go to the doctor whenever i have an issue like this however i am a soldier and we see special doctors  ones that have very long lines with people being very crowded which i am scared of because of corona therefore i am here it started today whenever i lift something heavy for example myself like doing a pull up i get really bad chest pain that stays there for a few minutes after exerting force this never happened to me so im a little scared but not scared enough to go to a doctor thank you for your help

for the past 5 weeks or so i noticed my stools have become very dry and large every other day it gets a little too uncomfortable to empty my bowl then im left with a slight sting
""
last week my partner asked if i had blood in my stool so i started to pay close attention to see if there was any blood and to my amazement i started to notice small patches of what looks like blood in the stool its not a lot but im pretty sure it is image below
""
the only thing that changed since all this started from what im aware of is that my rheumatologist doubled my allopurinol from 100mg once a day to twice a day for the treatment of gout unfortunately that dr no longer works at the practice so im unsure who to ask especially with a lockdown fully in force
""
is this a warning sign should i go get it checked out as a matter of urgency or can it wait until the lockdown is eased
""
many thanks

so for the past few days i noticed that my lower left jaw area was sort of tender to the touch nothing major just kind of tender to the touch well yesterday i was rubbing the area to see if it was still feeling the same i used a little more force to feel it and it started to hurt sort of a throbbing pain it lasted a few minutes then the pain subsided but since then it seems as if that area is more sensitive hot or cold food really hurt the teeth in that area and this morning when eating that area seemed to be sensitive to chewing causing slight pain
""
im worried about it being an abscess but if im not eating or rubbing the area im in no pain at all my face doesnt feel swollen and i dont really have any other symptoms with everything going on all the dentist locations in my area are closed the only option i have is the er but im not sure if this is something serious or not

""
first  some context
""
this weekend i was preparing my hot tub for the season i live in fargo nd i am going to repair the sides and replace some of the components i took some time to vacuum shopvac with a 05 micron filter inside as i noticed some debris behind the pump at this point i wasnt wearing any ppe other than basic leather gloves
""
as i removed the rear side  i found a couple of mouse nests i had received the hot tub secondhand about 5 years ago i believe it is a model from the late 90s while ive removed some of the sides before i had never removed the back side thus  these nests could have been from this year or they could be 20 years old no way to really know there is also a nearby pile of leavessticksetc from the yard that i will be disposing of this spring probably next weekend regardless  that pile of debris i was vacuuming behind the pump was probably a nest
""
there were no mice present but i had found a dead mouse in our driveway about a month ago which i disposed of with a shovel
""
upon finding the nests i immediately put on a p100 respirator latex gloves and shop glasses i sprayed the nests with bathroom disinfectant and eventually put the nests into a bag with the help of a stick unfortunately they werent soaked all the way through as they were deeper than anticipated
""
i then soaked the entire underside of the hot tub with water to mitigate dust i used the lowpressure like  garden hose pressure soap applicator of my pressure washer to coat every nook and cranny with dawns dish soap afterward letting it sit for a bit i sprayed it down with the wide tip for the pressure washer in hindsight  rinsing using the low pressure nozzle or a garden hose would have been the smarter choice i shouldnt have risked kicking up water droplets
""
i wiped down all of my tools with clorox wipes washed the vacuum multiple times i disposed of the filter and i plan to let everything sit for a week i will also spray lysol into the intake and exhaust of the vacuum before i consider using it indoors my shoes stayed outside and i immediately placed my clothes in the washing machine with extra detergent and hot water high heat for the dryer i then took a long warm shower
""
the main question
""
what do i do in this situation do i just wait and see if i come down with any symptoms do i go to the walkin and explain that i found mouse nests am i being paranoid
""
while i knew that you should be careful when dealing with rodent debris it wasnt until my panicked research that evening that i fully realized the severity of hantaviruses i feel like my clean up process was fairly reasonable minus the final high pressure rinse given the shortage of disinfectants from the covid19 pandemic but im particularly worried about when i was vacuuming at the start no ppe accidentally vacuuming a nest if nothing else  this is a learning experience for sure
""
ive read there are blood tests but what ive read from mayo and whatnot discusses it in the context of diagnosing once symptoms have appeared this just happened a day or two ago and i have no symptoms
""
i cant find any information one what to do if you dont have any symptoms i find that quite distressing
""
additional note
""
i checked my local hospitals evisit page there are only specific things the do over evisit and there is a questionnaire where you input your symptoms since it doesnt seem that an evisit in an option in my circumstance i would have to physically go in which i can do  but i dont want to do that if there is nothing they can do in the first place that is why i have come here first

not sure if this is even a medical thing or not but im really curious about what it was
""
i woke up around 7am this morning drank a cup of coffee did some dishes and then decided to take a nap around 10am
""
its really hard to explain but about halfway through my nap i was awake but not i could barely open my eyes i remember trying really hard to but my eyelids would not stay open for the life of me there was construction with chainsaws going on outside that i could hear and every time i would hear the chainsaw running or any noise in general it felt almost as if my entire head was buzzing kind of like an electric shock
""
i dont remember necessarily having any thoughts either as i said i was awake but not
""
the entire time it felt kind of like the general feeling of a panic attack
""
a friend suggested it was sleep paralysis but i dont think so because i rolled over a few times i was able to grab my phone but i couldnt do anything on it due to the aforementioned struggle of opening my eyes
""
someone also suggested it was a seizure but i dont think this is the case either
""
again not sure if this was something medical or just a strange occurrence

hi there i am a 26m 185cm tall61 765kg169lb white britishashkenazi jewish heritage type 3c diabetic diagnosed on my first pancreatitis flare up in 2015 exsmoker quit first of january 2018
""
i am an ambulance service worker however i feel this is greatly out of my field and scope of practice and would like some advice if possible
""
i have for the last 5 years been suffering with repeat flare ups of pancreatitis 21 in total all of which are idiopathic to quickly round up i do not drink alcohol i have had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy february 2018 and have not had evidence of gallstones prior to the lapcholy however it was initially thought that there could be a possibility of microscopic calcifications blocking ducts however the flare ups have continued post surgery i am currently under investigation for autoimmune pancreatitis
""
the last flare up 3 week hospitalisation was by my consultants explanation the worst flare up i had experienced since the first and i spent the first two nights in intensive care and the next week in high dependency unit before being stood down to a general surgical ward for the remainder of my hospitalisation throughout my hospitalisation i underwent ct and mri scanning as well as fluid therapy antiemetic treatment and pain therapy
""
i was discharged basically with the same medications i had been receiving in hospital on a month long prescription with medication review with my general practitioner and with the pain management team after that my medication list is as follows
""
insulin glargine toujeo solostar  50 units every night
""
novorapid insulin  as required i self dose by carb counting and monitoring for corrective doses as required
""
coamoxiclav 625mg tid  3 week course started in hospital in the second week

i have now been home for 2 weeks and i am still experiencing pain which i somewhat expect from previous flare ups but also an odd discomfort severe bloating in the upper abdomen and persistent frequent sulphurous eructation and nausea which is not easing at all sitting upright helps momentarily for the eructation however this is only ever a temporary fix of up to 1015 minutes the discomfort and bloating is also something i have never experienced before and usually the nausea would have gone within the first two weeks or so of a flare up and would normally be under kept under control with ondansetron or other antiemetics
""
unfortunately due to the current climate i am unable to get a face to face consultation with my gp and it seems out of his comfort zone when speaking to him on the phone i really dont think it warrants a visit to the emergency department at hospital but i am now left in limbo as to what this may be or how to treat it
""
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
hi folks really hoping someone here can help

ive got this reddish rashpatch thing with bumps that look like pimples right in the middle of my forehead super unattractive they look like maybe severe acne but theyre localized to this one patch they take a long time to go away they dont seem to respond to differin gel and if they do pop im trying to be gentle with them theres no pus like a pimple instead it looks like a really small hole with blood
""
a small number of them first started showing up about 68 weeks ago i wrote them off as pimples but they only got worse and more numerous over time i did that apostrophe thing and sent pictures to a dermatologist who prescribed me something for acne but she also said it could be a more serious condition yet she wouldnt say what it might be she recommended cleansing and moisturizing my face twice a day so ive been doing that up from once every 23 days and its certainly helping but very slowly and im not sure theyll ever just go away on their own oh and they itch like hell now but they didnt before i was cleansing so much
""
here are several pictures from a couple of weeks ago when it was at its worst and one picture i took just now should be clear which are which

oh and one more note i said the condition was localized to the patch in the middle of my forehead buuuut ive also gotten a few other suspicious pimples on my face since the forehead ones showed up for instance ive had 3 different ones pop up near my right temple very tight grouping and they also dont seem to act like normal pimples not sure if theyre related

i have a history of leukopenia but have not seen a hematologist since i was 18 12 years ago im a 30 yr old female last year my wbcs were normal for the first time ever in my 30 years i have no clue how or why this time a year later they are the lowest ever recorded for me i think about 400 lower than than my usual low leukopenia seems to be a genetic trait that runs on my mothers side of the family my wbcs actually increase when i eat a healthy diet i think by about a 1000 wbcs my diet from last year up until i found out about my wbcs was abysmal soda almost daily desserts twice a day on top of that    sometimes thats all i had for my meal i know thats not healthy no im not overweight or near it i just eat junk food
""
im worried my new hematologist wont hear me out and that shell ignore my request to try out a healthy diet and instead order a biopsy i had two of those as a teen and they all came back negative for cancer although i do not know why its low im not experiencing any issues and i feel like i am the cause of the lowering of my wbcs because of my poor dietary habits i overhauled my diet and started eating protein as i do not eat meat or attempt to replace it with alternatives and began eating fruits and veggies i plan to keep this as a lifestyle and i am interested to see if my wbc counts increase within a month of this new change

i was 13 this time
so in march this year i had a burning sensation in my stomach and had like something like phlegm mucus feeling like it was stuck in my throat i was breathing but breathing through my nose felt like i was not getting enough air or something so i started breathing in my mouth and nose i talked with my parents about this and they told me that it might be acid reflux since i ate at night and went to bed before allowing the food to be digested so i took some gaviscon tums and gastroaide then weeks went by and it felt fine again i was breathing through my nose again but 2 or 3 days later at night weird sensation was in my legs and moving my legs was the only way to find relief also not to mention my feet were very cold for some odd reason might be the temperature but am unsure i searched it up and google said it might be rls restless leg syndrome so i just ignored the weird sensation but still bothering me so i slept with my legs on layers of pillow and finally got some good sleep 2 days during the weird sensation twitching came and so i searched it up biggest mistake ever ms came up and it freaked me out but what was worse was the next one als this got me so scared and i started thinking about the worse even though the disease was rare but that fact did not help me at all i started looking up symptoms and twitching was always the early symptoms but i found relief in a youtube video explaining that als starts with clinical weakness not twitching and that twitching comes after the muscle is literally dead or something along those lines i found a bfs video and found relief but 2 weeks ago i felt a weird sensation in my right thumb felt weak or something i started testing my grip which just made it worse and it was starting to freak me out so i went to an als forum and found relief when somebody said that als weakness has nothing to do with weird feelings and that feelings mean nothing als weakness is basically waking up one morning and maybe your hand just wont be able to grip properly and you would struggle just lifting your hands up so i decided to just stop testing for good and after that my thumb started to feel normal again but there was pain when i grip something extremely hard there was pain in the ulna part of my right arm so i decided that it might be because i was testing too much the other day so i rested it next thing in the morning my right arm doesnt hurt that much now but my left one is the one hurting specifically the ulna part of my left arm is this anything serious

ps my twitching started in my legs and gradually spread in my upper limbs and now recently my neck and facial could this mean something serious

i believe in taking the least amount of meds as possible but reality is nsaids dont really do anything even gabapentin lyrica helps a little more but i still live with 5710 pain

honestly the only thing that made it better was fentanyl patches 100mcgh with 4mg of hydromorphone up to 4x a day i would only take hydromorphone only when resting changing positions and nsaids didnt work at least an hour to 2 of trying then i would take my break through pain medication 4mg hydromorphone

so my so was prescriped olanzapine 30mgday upon being released from the hospital for a episode of psychosis in early feb she received a referral to another doctor to manage her medication on an outpatient basis the new provider is not affiliated with the hospital my so is on medical assistance from the state which requires a renewal every year around the same time the renewal was sent to an old address and subsequently the insurance lapsed new paperwork has been submitted but since that time the coronavirus pandemic has led to a huge delay in being able to process the paperwork so her insurance is still inactive the doctor prescribing her medication will not refill it without an appointment being scheduled which we cannot do right now because they want the full price out of pocket around 500 for no insurance
""
my so says the medication helps her tremendously and even if she misses a days does she starts to have a return of her psychosis symptoms to complicate matters further she is under a court order to continue taking this medication as a condition of a stay of commitment

hello im a 20 yo healthy female im 52 and a 125 lb i have had pain on my right pelvic side for a while now when i had my first iud august 2019 i was fine around october i started to feel the pain i ended up finding out i was pregnant i went to my gyno and it was a normal healthy pregnancy they made sure that there wasnt an ectopic pregnancy following that i ended up miscarrying and had a dampc a few weeks following that i had the worst pain on my right pelvic side and went to the ed had an ultrasound which showed some remaining tissue and fluids i was given medication to treat that i felt fine till a few weeks following that the pain came back i went to my gyno for a follow up and had an ultra sound done which was normal i then had another iud in place and the pain has just been constant i went to my gyno again for the pain and had another ultrasound which showed a small cyst on my right ovary that seems to have been healing this was about three months ago and the pain hasnt gotten any better its been constant and it worst when standing it stops me from doing anything because i am in so much pain i would love to see if anyone has any other opinion to what might be the cause of the pain
ive also had normal labs
im a 6ft whiteish portuguese not exactly white guy weighting 180 pounds and leading a routine filled lifestyle wake up around 6am go for a 45min run eat breakfast go to classes return home eat go to the gym back home finish any work i have left and go to sleep around 10pm

ive been under adhd treatment concerta since i was 8 with some dose changes and downtime here and there without any issues
""
the problem is that 6 or 7 months ago i began feeling tired at weird times around the day without any changes to either my schedule my workload or my sleep time it has not increased in intensity since then but i have become quite concerned about it because sometimes it strikes at really unfortunate times at class while running while doing homework while playing games and i have to stop doing whatever it is just to close my eyes and try to pick up some energy or whatever to keep up whatever im doing
""
i currently lack health insurance residing in mexico not yet citizen and my mothers insurance does not cover my treatment anymore and im not sure if this is a doctorworthy visit so im trying to look for advice either to recognize what the hell is happening to me or to just get convinced to or not to go for a checkup

my sleep schedule has been super out of whack lately so i bought some walgreens brand sleep aid its the same thing as benadryl and the dosage is 150mg which id take about an hour before i wanted to fall asleep
""
lately that hasnt really been doing anything for me and ive been up all night the last few nights which obviously sucks so i was wondering if itd be safe to take 300mg tonight instead to get to sleep at an early time and get my sleep schedule back on track

so long story short as i can make it ive been having worsening muscle spasmspain and joint pain since winter 2018 it has made me nearly completely unable to exercise yoga is impossible because of balancing issues i fall over and muscle pain becomes worse after exercise winter 2019 however i began breaking out in a extremely itchy rash all over my backupper butt area the first flare lasted from novemberjanuary i have since flared once a month for up to a week since jan the rash is always on my back in march it was also on my right hand and last week on my upper arms started 422 until 426 still have some spotshives but they no longer itch
""
this past month i have had two separate muscle spasm spells associated with my neckshoulders both occurring in the morning after first waking up on the first i raised my arms above my head to stretch and felt a burning jolt of pain in my neck and upper back this was followed with an inability to move upper backshoulders for about 4 days without severe pain pcp prescribed baclofen the second happened yesterday when pulling my blanket to cover me same thing occurred i felt a sharp burning pain along the right side of my neck and my right shoulder blade followed by severe pain upon trying to move my right shoulder baclofen has really helped with this second spell did not have it for the first and my shoulder feels almost normal it usually takes up to a week2 weeks before normal movement is restored
""
historic muscle spasms have mainly affected my legs and upper back april 2019 i could not raise my arms over my head without pain june 2019 both thighs were so tight that i could not walk upright without extreme pain for 35 days before beginning to subside july 2019 upper back and neck were so painful that even laying down was uncomfortable could not lift or bend upper body without severe pain
""
in addition regular exercise has become next to impossible im only able to go on daily walks and even then sometimes my leg muscles andor knee joints ache or hurt i used to do yoga 34 times a week but last year i began fallinglosing balance in poses that used to not give me any problems such as halfmoon i was also going to the gym 23 times a week doing muscle group exercises and cardio but i had to pretty much stop by november last year because of difficultyexacerbation of symptoms
""
and around since february i have been experiencing ongoing cardio symptoms my pcp has clocked me with bradycardia twice my blood pressure is fluctuating between being low and high and i have also been noticing palpitationsfluttering and shortness of breath
""
so with all of that my allergist just got back with me about some labs i had done in march she pointed out that i had low c3 complement normal c4 complement and high iga antibodies she is going to have me repeat the complement test and is having me do a h pylori bag test this in addition to my test results that showed low rbc and ferritin are sticking out to me
""
is there anything that anyone can think of that could be causing my symptoms the rash and muscle spasms are definitely the worst out of all of them am i looking in the right places is there any other specialist i should put on my radar im just trying to get any further ideaspossibilities that you may have my symptoms seem to only be getting worseaffecting random areas of my body my allergist amp pcp are of the mindset that it is more likely that there is 12 things that are causing my symptoms instead of multiple smaller disorders is that fair to say
""
any helpinsight is very much appreciated apologies if the post is too long amp let me know if you need any more informationphotos i really just want to get to the bottom of this

hello  i am a 59 156 pounds 27 year old female last week thursday i self administered two fleet sodium phosphate 45 oz133 ml enemas backtoback i retained the first one for 2 minutes and 30 seconds then expelled it fully with some hard brokenup stool no fluid was retained in my bowels to my knowledge i waited about a minute or two then administered the second enema as the first did not seem satisfactory i retained the second enema for about 2 minutes i expelled it with a bit more stool i do not believe any of the fluid was retained in my bowels following expulsion i have been experiencing chronic constipation with hard brokenup stools for a few months i take ibuprofen as needed when i experience headaches or back pain  generally 24 times a month usually two 200 mg tablets each time
""
about four hours later i experienced a lot of fatigue but no other symptoms i was generally wellhydrated and i drank a glass of water with electrolyte powder mixed in in addition to drinking water throughout the evening as thirst demanded
""
the next morning friday i woke up with a severe headache body aches and nausea i drank a lot of water and some gatorade and ate some potato chips as that was the only thing that seemed tolerable to my stomach shortly after i vomited and pooped a bit more stools were still hard and broken up i slept on and off throughout the day feeling nauseous and experiencing a headache the whole time my fatigue generally did not subside i ate some chicken ramen from trader joes for lunch and was able to keep it down i had trouble consuming fluids due to the nausea around 3 pm i contacted a doctor and was prescribed ondansetron 4 mg for the nausea and was told i could take ibuprofen as needed for my headache i took two 200 mg tablets of ibuprofen with some crackers and water after taking one ondansetron tablet i was able to drink water and eat dinner and my symptoms generally subsided i asked the doctor if i should be worried about kidney damage or any other longterm effects and he said no unless the symptoms persist in which case i should get my electrolytes checked
""
the next morning i had a headache and body aches again as well as fatigue after taking two more 200 mg tablets of ibuprofen and drinking coffee i felt fine albeit a little giddy and restless from the caffeine i was able to exercise and generally felt okay after that i drink a cup of coffee every morning so i suspect some of the illness i was experiencing was from caffeine withdrawal
""
ive been feeling fatigued ever since friday and have been napping more than usual im specifically concerned about acute phosphate nephropathy acute kidney damage of any kind and electrolyte imbalances given the fact that i only retained the two enemas for a total of less than five minutes altogether am i just being paranoid or should i be concerned about longterm health problems from this i dont know how much phosphorus i could have absorbed from it but its seriously concerning me
are osmotic tension pressure resistance and fragility the same

back in 2017 i was diagnosed with eustachian tube dysfunction i had a constant sensation of fullness and felt like i needed to pop my ears but popping them didnt relieve the feeling i also had an earache in my right ear and when i hiccuped or yawned i had a painful bulging sensation in my eardrum a few times a week the hearing goes completely muffled in that ear following by a highpitched ringing before returning to normal i had ttubes placed but found no relief for the duration they were inserted my symptoms remained the same
""
the tube in my right ear has since been removed but now in addition to my usual symptoms fullness a need to pop bulging im experiencing pulsatile tinnitus it started as a low whooshing but has recently morphed into a sound like someone hitting a hihat over and over in the distance it happens most often when i go from sitting up to lying down and it can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to stop ive mentioned this to my ent several times but he only checks for a bruit confirms he does not hear one and never addresses the whooshing again i have normal blood pressure
""
between the pain and the tinnitus im at my wits end my doctor wants to try balloon dilation since the tubes failed but im reluctant to do so because he cant really explain what is going on i understand its impossible to say for sure without examining me but i would appreciate any thoughts about what might be going on im at a complete loss

23m had advanced vericoceleleft and testicular atrophyboth embolization was performed last year to correct vericocele currently recovered as varicocele shrinks my question
""
since i still have testicular atrophy  both are the size of raisins and its far too late to save them should i look into taking otc supplements or seeing my urologist to try to get steroids the main problem with the second option while more reliable is that theres the pandemic going on outside and seeing that i no longer have insurance from my company its possible that thatll be the bank breaker route at this point

recently i have been running in the morning the problem is that about 1hr before i feel sick to my stomach and feel like throwing up i would then go to the bathroom crap my brains out and exercise this would continue during the run but very subtle i would feel the need to throw up and i dont throw up
""
this has been happening for about 1 12 weeks now my mom suggested that i dont eat any sweets the night before and that didnt help i tested that out for a few nights at first i thought that i was breathing wrong after a few days but that wasnt the case

symptoms pain and pressure from lumbar region radiating to right upper buttock and later entire right leg and calf
""
i had extreme back pain in my lumbar region with pain radiating to my right upper buttock after three work shifts with heavy lifting i reported this to my work immediately and told them that i believed that it may be nerve related
""
they gave me the rest of the week off to recover instead of having me start workers compensation paperwork after a few days the acute pain subsided however there was lingering lesser pain and feelings of pressure the regions affected
""
after three weeks they allowed me to file workers compensation paperwork and be seen by an industrial clinic my treating physician diagnosed me with a strain of the lumbar spine and ignored my descriptions of what i was feeling in my leg the prescribed treatment was tens therapy with a hot pack for a number of weeks and later back centralized resistance machine exercises including
""
 calf extensions
 seated leg curl
 ab crunch
 back extension
 rotary torso
""
 additionally they tested my lift capacity twice
""
during this time i was made to work at a light duty store where i was on my feet a few hours longer than at my old job my symptoms slowly spread all the way down my leg making it difficult to remain on my feet for the majority of the shift without the aid of pain killers
""
when my treating physician realized i wasnt getting any better they ordered an mri which revealed three bulging disks the physician stated that despite their presence i should not be experiencing the symptoms that i had been for the past couple months shortly thereafter i went to another clinic where they provided acupuncture and stretch exercises my symptoms are still present and have gotten marginally worse
""
i am under the impression that the lack of action and poor diagnoses and treatment contributed to a negative outcome am i accurate in my assumptions

21m last night i was having trouble sleeping i was still awake at 5am then my mom tried to wake me at 11am but i felt like the room was spinning endlessly so i decided to go back to sleep at 4pm i woke up and was feeling the same eventually i got up to go to the bathroom to do n2 then as i walk back to my room i felt like i was about to pass out i sat in my bed for a second and everything was moving 10 seconds later i was running to the bathroom to throw up i cannot lay down cause everything starts spinning and i throw up again and im cold and sweating a lot i have never experienced anything like this no clue whats going on thanks
the title might come off as vague but ill give detail here

im a 21yo male
""
i sometimes experience what feels like hot flashes from my neck up will start to feel hot and start to perspire a bit not like beads of sweat but moisture forsure
""
ive noticed that when this happens another symptom i have is a discomfort in my mouth my tongue specifically
""
right now as im having one of these episodes i went and checked in the mirror and sure enough towards the very back of my tongue i have what look like blisters theyre not pussey or anything
""
ive experienced this for a while now and can never pinpoint what the triggers are it happens when i eat certain foods  but ive been tested food allergy and have been negative for all
16m 511 203 pounds on my left foots arch i have bout three somewhat faint red spots they are kinda large about a couple centimeters long ive had the spot for years but ive always wondered what it is my feet are flat does it have anything to do with that
im really sorry about this but heres a picturehttpsimgurcomaaqwlwqj i know i have hpv because i had some warts on the shaft of my penis that i intended to get taken care of before all of this happened i never got around to it then after the lockdown i started noticing the purple rim of the head of my penis developing a weird white spot the white spots now grown to what you see here i really dont want to go to a hospital if i dont have to right now but i also dont want to lose my penis its been unbelievably stressful so any help is appreciated
hello i would go ask a doctor for this one but due to the pandemic its a bit difficult heres the situation and everything i tried 
""
28m vegetarian for 2 years i noticed some months ago maybe 1 year difficult to know when it started that my lower abdomen is bloated all the time swollen i am tall and slim so it is noticeable and very annoying to me i have no pain which is good i eat enough fibres to go to the toilet once a day i eat as healthy as i can i do intermittent fasting where i usually eat between 2pm and 10pm nothing outside that
""
so from all that i concluded that its apparently not due to constipation or bad food habits and intermittent fasting is said to help on the bloating problem but nope
""
recently i stopped eating dairy products for close to a week suspecting a lactose intolerance i felt like it was a little bit better but could have been something else not frankly noticeable
""
a few months ago i had a bad flu and couldnt eat much in 3 days i had 1 proper meal and still my belly was swollen less than usual but still
""

about a week ago i woke up with very sore nipples and slightly tender breasts throughout the week ive been wearing sturdy but not too tight bras i am a bigger chested woman around a d or dd now a week later my nipples are barely sore but my breasts themselves have become more soretender than they were at first i have felt around and found no lumps but they do feel firmer than before i work as a semi truck driver and spotter truck driver the latter of which can be physically demanding i noticed it started after wearing a new bra that is rather snug on me why i am concerned is my family history of cancer pretty much every kind you can think of including breast as well as other serious health issues my doctor is currently not seeing patients due to covid19 my question more or less is should i be concerned here

19f 110lb 55 globus gerd and hiatal hernia nexium to stop reflux non smoker and non drinker

so about three days ago i ate this dinner my dad made it was a bit spicy rooky mistake but hey i needed to eat but otherwise fine that night i had extremely painful heartburn i was tossing and turning sweating and my chest was burning ive had chest pain before as ive been diagnosed with mild gerd for almost a year now and ive been taking nexium which has been until now pretty helpful but this was on a whole other level
i went to sleep eventually hoping itd be gone in the morning unfortunately it was not in fact it was just as bad and now whenever i eat i get really bad heartburn usually the worst after dinner
i wouldnt be here just for that though the reason im on here is because food has started going back up my throat after eating now this happened a few times in the past very mildly but i still rang my doctor and he said it was just globus i didnt really think about much after that until now
i was just laughing with my sisters after dinner my sister said something particularly funny and i was laughing loads when suddenly a bunch of food came up my throat not acidic weirdly and went back down my throat but the wrong way like when your food accidentally goes down the other tube i couldnt breath for a sec and immediately started coughing and spluttering even when i felt id got it out it still felt like a pool of food was resting at the back of my throat and as im writing this it still feels that way
im nervous that itll happen again and ill choke or something it was really scary and im nervous about it but i think my doctor wants to avoid seeing me at all costs rightly so as hes quite old so i suppose im asking should i be worried about
