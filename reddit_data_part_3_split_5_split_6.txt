i got my period pretty young at ten years old when it first started it was normal i had cramps but they werent too bad id occasionally throw up but for the most part it was okay flash forward to when i was thirteen and the period pain was unbearable everytime id get it id throw up the thing is i couldnt take medicine because anything i ate would make me vomit once i was just chewing on gum to get my mind off of things and i threw up blue from the gum that year was the worst and my periods lasted for the whole week sometimes more during it im now fifteen and everything was getting a bit better but for the past months it just got way worse i dont throw up anymore and my periods just last about 4 days  but the period pain just got ten times worse i cant get out of bed and nothing works not medicine or heating pads which used to help tremendously  my mother thinks im over exaggerating about my pain and refuses to take me to the doctor

ive included a couple of pictures in the imgur link above this paragraph to give you guys a clearer ummm picture of whats the situation and i would be massively relieved if this turned out to be a nonissue because as of the time of writing the country i currently reside in is under a 16hour curfew public transport is shut down and my car is busted so going to a doctor isnt really an easy option
hi there im a 18 year old female who smokes marijuana recreationally and am always getting sick im not able to meet with my doctor bc im quarantining in a different state i have a fever of 101 and its hurts to swallow im pretty sure i have strep throat ive had it before but im not sure where i got it from im trying to avoid having to go to urgent care but have been drinking tea and water all day ive been taking tylenol and using cough drops i take the air borne vitamins and have been socially distancing any advice thanks
so about a week or so i decided to quit eating refined sugar and start limiting the times of day i would eat usually about a 24 hour window prior to this i had a very unhealthy sugar filled and heavy carb diet now im eating mostly vegetables with some meat and dairy and sometimes nuts
""
whats worrying me is that i test my blood sugar levels two hours after eating and they just keep seem to be dropping near the start of the week it was 36 then 32 and yesterday it was 3 i havent been diagnosed with diabetes but it wouldnt surprise me due to my inactive and unhealthy lifestyle i understand that it could be the sudden shift in diet but i havent been able to find anybody whos had a similar experience to mine so its frustrating trying to address it ive seen many people argue whether dropping blood sugars like that is a sign of insulin resistance which i was trying to prevent with my diet change ive also read that people who are fasting dont tend to have blood sugars this low if it matters im 140lbs and 19f thank you for any advice

i posted here httpswwwredditcomrintermittentfastingcommentsg9dweqlow_blood_sugar_hours_after_eatinghttpswwwredditcomrintermittentfastingcommentsg9dweqlow_blood_sugar_hours_after_eating what i specifically eat in a day and when i eat today ive started eating something small like a strawberry when i feel dizzy

my past posts go into detail of what i have been experiencing as well as the severity of the initial presentation of whatever is going on with my body as i deteriorated very quickly
in one post at least i described my eyes protruding the first time i now know thyroid eye disease can cause protrusion as well that a lot of my symptoms during that time signal as a thyroid storm yet my tsh and t4 has been normal twice when checked but was not during the extreme phase i can not get treated until i know whats wrong yet i dont know what else could be going on theres no doubt in my mind i have it my eyes range from starey like to bulging and selenium does help like those with ted could i have antibodies pertaining to graves disease with normal labs otherwise i was a smoker for 4 years as well so im wondering if its possible to have developed the eye disease portion and my labs will possibly reflect hyperactivity in the future

""

""
the weird symptoms happened this week when i noticed my asthma was somewhat better but i would cough from time to time cause i am smoking when i would cough i would get pain on the right side of the head around the eye area like a headache that would last for a couple of seconds that worried me a bit cause i had it for 2 or 3 days after those days i only got it once or twice so i assumed it got better then other symptoms came such as a weird sensation in the back of the head on the right side mostly like a heat patch and very mild pain or just something discomforting there then after that i started to get dizzy and feel really weird and had quite a bad vision like my eyes could not focus on stuff and id get disconnected from everything for seconds and just staring at my screen and get random thoughts which felt a bit dreaming and my eyes would hurt a bit and the sensation in the back of the head would get a bit stronger that made me very anxious and i suspect that might of happened cause of anxiety but i cant tell for sure if its that or something else when i start working and i forget about it i would feel perfectly normal only would notice the strange sensation in the back of the head from time to time i would of visit a doctor but where i live its pretty dangerous to go outside right now and to get to a doctor i would have to go to urgent care which is even more dangerous cause of the covid i would really appreciate if someone would tell me if its something serious or just something caused by lifestyle or asthma or even anxiety thank you

starting about 30 minutes ago i noticed i could feel my heartbeat in my chest very pronounced and that it was beating very quickly ive been watching movies with my husband and havent been very active for several hours we both checked my heart rate and its somewhere between 120 and 130 my chest feels tight and i get very dizzy if i stand up it feels a lot like an anxiety attack but im very relaxed and fairly comfortable i know it isnt my hypoglycemia because i ate a sandwich about an hour ago does anyone know whats going on with me should i be worried or will it go away on its own i do not currently have a primary care physician and hospitals in my area are totally swamped
after the current world event at the moment of course im very afraid for my boyfriend hes only growing bigger and bigger and bigger over time we have been together for three years and three months and in this time he has not seen a dentist nor a doctor for anything im assuming the last time hes been to a doctor was at least over four years ago my boyfriend is nearing if not already 400lbs he is 615 and im super concerned for him he was just under 300lbs when i started dating him and he was always sliiightly chubby when we were kids in school together he get upset anytime i bring up his weight but its really starting to get under my skin he has had a growing bump on the right mid part of his back and its been there for id say probably eight months now he has skin discoloration on places such as his neck his elbows and his knuckles his mouth used to smell last year from a bad cavity his tooth was almost black i believe from what i could see in the back of his mouth he walks with his feet a little funny almost spayed inwards a little bit nothing serious he is however strong and seemingly healthy as in not wheezing not having trouble exercising he works as a security guard in a store he just seems to be gaining weight like crazy i havent seen him in four months due to the virus but we video chatted last week when he tried to break up with me i suspect hes become very self conscious and didnt think he deserved my love anymore but he took it back a few hours later and made some efforts to talk to me again and he had gotten so big it was legitimately terrifying to me he was shirtless i have to accept i cant make him lose weight but is there any way i could convince him to see a doctor ive been concerned he has prediabetes since we started dating but hes only getting worse and its very stressful we are only 20 he has his whole life ahead of him not to develop diabetes i dont know what his family medical history is but his mother is also morbidly obese and his brother seems to be gaining some weight as well his sister is also overweight but the other siblings are not obese his father was slightly chubby as well he doesnt have a normal biological family so i dont know what the rest of his blood family looks like aside from probably a few cousins and auntsuncles who are also overweight i think its worth mentioning that we are in america where most of us are underweight my point im concerned do i have a right to be does anything i mention sound very serious how can i get him to stop avoiding the doctors and perhaps catch something before it gets worse he told me he doesnt have any doctors and im unsure about the state of his insurance but they are quite poor im sorry if this is not the usual post on this sub but im desperate now

over the weekend i randomly had a lot of blood in my urine or it at least it looked like a lot my urine was dark brown if not red i went to the er i had a ct scan bloodwork and urinalysis done they did not find anything on the ct scan other than a punctate nonobstructing stone my bladder is unremarkable and i have mild prostatomegaly with calcification my blood levels were normal the urinalysis showed a bacterial infection the report i received didnt specify the type of bacteria i was given a 6 day course of cipro and sent on my way i was told to come back if the infection returned or if i had any sort of clot

i started my antibiotics that night and by morning my urine was clear
""
i followed up with my urologist today and i was encouraged to get a cystoscopy to rule out bladder cancer he emphasized that utis in men are very uncommon and more than likely this is an indicator of something else he also said that a ct scan isnt that great for finding possible issues in the bladder
""
i didnt really have any pain when this happened maybe some burning but when i went to pee i just felt like i had to pee and that was it i do have a history of kidney stones ive had one and had it removed i dont know the kind of kidney stone it was would an infection like this be an indicator of bladder cancer is a cystoscopy something that is necessary

symptoms occasional reynauds phenomenom in right hand swollen lymph nodes in neck
""
back in february i had a few appointments with my doctor because i was having trouble sleeping for about a month she said i was probably just depressed and had me start taking antidepressants i had depression pretty bad a few years back and didnt feel anything like i did then but i took them anyway for a few weeks then stopped because they were making me feel worse at the same appointment i showed her a picture of my hand i had taken where my fingers had turned white and numb after coming in from outside she didnt say much about it but had me get some blood work done the tests came back with slightly elevated protein platelet count and mpv everything else was within normal range
""
the reynauds phenomenom happens about once a month on average this week it has happened twice in one week and usually lasts about 10 minutes with my fingers being white and numb it always occurs on my right hand only once it happened on my right foot
""
she gave me a referral to a reumatologist but i never got around to making an appointment before the covid 19 craziness started
""
last year i had went to the same doctor after noticing the lymph nodes in my neck and under my chin were swollen she thought it was from a few pimples i had on my chin at the time and gave me some acne ointment to apply the pimples did go away after a few weeks but the lymph node swelling remained over the past year they have been swollen on and off sometimes painful
""
im wanting to know if these two symptoms warrant a visit to the reumatologist id hate to make an appointment only to find out this is completely normal
hello
""
so ive had some issue for the longest time id say since about 2015ish about the spring time every year from 20122015 i would end up getting bronchitis i remember the symptoms every time if i exhaled long enough i could clearly hear mucus buildup in my lungs just felt like a mucusy cold but in 2015 i did not get treated or get medicine usually an inhaler for the symptoms i assumed it was bronchitis and i just brushed it off and pushed through
""
during this time id cough and cough and cough and spit up mucus on repeat for days after it all cleared up my cough continued though it was just a constant feeling of mucus being stuck in my throat or in the lower trachea area sometimes i would ended up coughing up mucus other times i would be dry coughing which could cause headaches cause me to lose sleep or cause my throat to be dry and raspy and it feels like its just making my throat sore but the majority of times its a feeling of this like lump in my throat that i just cant even get out i can feel my neck being terribly tense and ive learned how to relax the muscle in my neck so theyre not sore and hurting from being tense constantly coughing and swallowinggulping
""
the thing is i cant remember me actually coughing unless i think in my head that i havent cough the second i havent been coughing comes in my head i start getting urges to cough remedies include occasional steammist sleep ive been told i dont cough when i sleep and hot teas sometimes help
""
when i went to a doctor awhile back to see what it may be he told me it was a habitual cough and its all in my head but if its in my head why would i be coughing up mucus its super thick and ranges from a light green kinda clear look i cant really remember the color
""
this has been an issue for 5 years now and i really dont know if its a habitual cough or its something else when ive gotten checked up theyve never noticed issues with my breathing and my recent checkups claim me to be healthy so what could it be what should i try to do

two weeks ago i had a large bump on my right armpit and the doctor said there was an infection and fluid build up so i ended up having an iampd
my antibiotics just ended on saturday i took them for 14 days 7 days before the procedure and 7 days after
""
while that was going on my upper arm hurt slightly i figured it was due to that bump the infection and the fact that i couldnt move it much
however it is still hurting and i think has gotten a little worse but not too too painful
at first it felt like a strained muscle now when i touch my arm it feels like its been bruised or something
the pain goes from the middle of my arm to my elbow more towards the left side of my arm towards my body

is this something to be worried about or should i just give it time to resolve on its own

hello i noticed a elongated somewhat fixed bump on the corner of my forehead where my hairline starts it feels mostly hard and fixed though i guess it might roll slightly if i roll my finger over it its about a cm or so long and maybe 25 cm wide there is no pain and there is zero evidence of it by looking at my skin i dont have it on the other side i may have had this my entire life but for whatever reason i noticed it yesterday for the first time it almost feels like a hard vein or ligament etc could this be normal anatomy or something more

hello on saturday april 18th i dropped a 15 pound weight on my ring and middle finger of my left hand the middle finger had some broken off pieces in the tip and the ring finger had a crack along the first knuckle it looks like my nail on my middle finger took the brunt of the damage as the back end of the nail pierced up through the skin causing my nail to be disconnected from the nail bed from about half way down the nail back the front end of the nail is still attached when i went to urgent care they just bandaged it and gave me antibiotics
""
then i got an appointment with a hand and wrist specialized surgeon for that following tuesday he xrayed me said surgery wouldnt be needed but then took tweezers and started lifting the nail from the back to see if he saw lacerations on the nail bed that hurt so bad because he also was pressing down on my very bruised finger to do this he bandaged me up told me to come back in a week
""
i went back today and he did the same with tweezers and then cut along the half way point of the nail with no medication given even though i felt like i was gonna pass out from the pain so now i only have the front half of my nail attached and the back half missing and still tons of pain because of a now exposed nail bed through all of this i feel like the xray techs and doctors have been very unhelpful in pain management since they keep pushing down on the finger or essentially ripping my nail off with no local anesthesia shot like i saw online doctors typically do for nail removal
""
how long will it take for my nail bed to not hurt everytime i rinse it what will happen to the front end of my nail would you suggest i try and find a more patient and caring practice i never am good with pain so i am scared to go back and him rip off the rest of my nail

iv had the sensation of something caught in my throat for over a week more specifically you cant see it by looking in my mouth its in the very back of my throat and pushed up against the corner of my tongue iv tried coughing it up massaging my throat gargling if theres a remedy iv probably done it
""
i got so fed up today that i reached my middle finger all the way back to my throat and was able to touch what was there after feeling it 23 more times its become clear that its not a piece of food or something caught its a moveable lump the size of a half a piece of corn

i tried digging it out but it just seems to move away from my finger and move back to its original position after i retract

i have a history of a right flat foot and falling arches i sometimes have foot pain when walking without shoes or arch support i am an obese 525 and 260 lbs 24 yo female

diabetes runs in my family and i was previously diagnosed with hyperinsulinemia but that seems to have lessened over the years and stabilized i have generally normal blood sugar that is under 125 mgdl normally between 75 mgdl and 105 mgdl i do not take any medication
""
i am most concerned if i have the beginnings of foot ulcers the side of my shoes tends to wear through evenly on the outer edge of my arches so i suppose most of my weight is bearing in those areas those areas seem to have thick calluses but are also very flaky and dry
""
i have not been wearing arch support recently and have been in flip flops slippers or bare footed most of the time at home the portion of my feet that wore down in a circular fashion seems to be areas where my feet bear a lot of weight and therefore builds a lot of friction when i walk
""
the tops of my feet have a tendency to make clicking sounds when i walk but no diagnosis has been yet made i suspect that i might have a stress fracture or two that is causing me to bear weight oddly i also have a tendency to shuffle when i walk

my question is do any doctors out there actually know a safeor safest way for me to play with smoke can you tell me about how it works comparing against vaping smoking is there actually a safe way out there for me to play with smoke

i was at the gym last year and felt a twinge in my left hip had shooting pain for a little bit but cleared it up with a few trips to the pt and doing the exercises given no more shooting pain buy am way more aware of my left side of the hip especially when im getting fatigued when exercising like towards the end of a 5 mile walk no pain but while doing the exercises for this i noted that my left knee would hurt in certain positions along the inner side i started doing some stretching for that and it calmed down a little went to an orthopedist had xrays nothing torn just said i probably stretched my mcl  going to pt about it now
""
but ive been trying to assess things in my daily life that might have contributed to the sudden downturn because it seems odd that i twinged my hip in the first place doing nothing major and that my knee took a dive too maybe there was some slow build up of something i was doing that caused it to finally go
""
i just had the realization that i mostly sleep on my left hand side the same side with the issue and i think in general if i lie down or even just sitting on my knees i tend to lean on my left side probably because im right handed
""
but how much might this affect the area and be at least a partial cause of my issues if i strengthen my hipknee up and continue the exercises to keep it that way should i have to worry about trying to really alter my positions i have started putting a pillow between my knees since knee to knee contact hurt

for about a year and a half now i have been experiencing symptoms a sharp pain in the centre of my stomach that comes in waves which is tender to touch bad nausea after eating anything no matter how large or small the portion strange gurgling sounds in the middle and left of my stomach almost constantly sometimes they are very loud and cause bubbling sensations which is uncomfortable bloating and hardness below my rib cage and a very low appetite
""
i have been to see a gp at least 10 times about these issues each time i have been prescribed a different medication zofram cyclizine metaclomopramide lanzoprazole and omeprazole none of them worked to ease symptoms apart from zofram with the nausea but as it is expensive for the nhs and difficult to get i struggle to get it so just use it on very rare occasions it was passed of as acid reflux and indigestion a couple of times until my gp cancelled that idea
""
i feel like my symptoms arent being listened to properly i had a test to see if i had any bacteria in my stomach which came back negative but i havent had any other tests i was referred back to the gastro specialist around a year ago waited 6 months for an appointment which was rearranged and then had a further 2 cancelled due to the current situation which i understand i received a letter saying my appointment will be followed up in a years time as the doctor assessed my notes
i dont feel comfortable waiting that long i may be over thinking but as i lie in bed typing this i have a sharp pain and a lot of stomach gurgling i have only eaten a banana and some toast all day as i cant stomach anything else without feeling extremely sick i know my body and i know something definitely isnt right with my stomach
""
i also mentioned to my doctor a couple of times that i am physically unable to burp and instead i just get the hiccups my mum said even as a child i never burped so she had to spend ages trying to wind me i wonder if this could be partly whats causing the issues i can drink a whole can of fizzy drink and still be physically unable to burp i dont know how to force myself to either it just never happens and i dont think ive ever burped once in my entire life
""
i would also like to ask is it safe to take metaclomopramide and cyclizine long term they were both on repeat prescription so i take these a lot and have done for at least a year now

i have ptsd
""
i was raped by someone who was my close friend when i was 16 i didnt tell anyone when i was raped because my uncle exposed himself to me when i was 14 i went to my dad who told me since i was in my uncles home there was nothing he could do my dad said my uncle had a right to do what he wanted sinces its property so when i got raped at 16 i didnt tell a soul i disassociated and kept telling myself i would start over
""
i did start over i moved to the other side of the country and i never talked about what happened to me when i met my husband we took things slow but he never asked why or pushed so i didnt tell him either
""
finally the demon came out one night as i was having a ptsd flashback with my husband we talked about it i was due to have a pap smear and i was a mess i had been with my gen practitioner for years and i honestly trust her plus she gave me a strong valium to take before the procedure
""
well it didnt work i lost my shit and got extremely combative my gen practitioner couldnt get a good sample so my gen practitioner referred me to an obgyn and in the letter it says i have severe ptsd from sexual trauma and should be sedated for procedures due to my combative nature i also was combative with a radiology tech as well on a separate occasion
""
well the obgyn wants to try to do a pelvic exam and place an iud without any medication or sedation she referred me to try emdr therapy before the appointment i have been told by emdr specialist that they cannot do the therapy online as the obgyn thinks obgyn also said that i need to go into this with a good mindset i honestly try so fucking hard too but its like an animal within me just comes out and will fight like hell to get the fuck out of there
""
am i the asshole for thinking the obgyn is a fucking idiot
hi everyone

i am a 34 year old caucasian female who was just diagnosed today with a rare condition called diffuse dermal angiomatosis of the breast a form of reactive angioendotheliomatosis this was confirmed after biopsies of multiple sizes and depths it appears that there have only been about 100 people studied for this condition and to make things worse none of them were pregnant i am 22 weeks along and cannot safely go through with any of the known treatments as they all pose a threat to the baby has anyone heard of this condition or know which type of specialist i should reach out to for further help
6 weeks ago i came down with fever fatigue chills loss of appetite and diarrhea tested positive on the 8th day avoided the gnarly resp symptoms which im grateful for however my doc prescribed me a zpak about 11 days i think to prevent a secondary bacterial infection once i finished the course i started to get some acid reflux started a 2 week course of omeprazole and by the 6th day i became super bloated since then ive had inconsistent bowels not diarrhea upper abdominal bloating silent reflux symptoms doc prescribed me carafate and told me to start taking the omeprazole my stress levels have never been higher and have no idea where this is going my heads been bouncing back and forth between maybe im still fighting off the infectionpost viral inflammationantibiotics really fd my gut upor this is all stress related dont wish this hell on anyone

im 22 ive suffered multiple traumatic events in my life including random physical assault sexual assault im a male dog hit by car in front of me when i was a teen psychedelic bad trip which severed my relationship with my brother i always whiteknuckle the pain i constantly exercise i meditate etc and i am highly functional despite this i still feel immense pain some days
""
from this post i would love if anyone could offer me any sorts of closure on where i can either do further research into whats going on with me it would be so highly appreciated
""
im at a point where ive passed my tipping point in regards to trauma i have a hard time understanding myself now and my current ideology is to simply trust in what is it is for a reason
""
i am emotional like ive never been i developed bad obsessions related to trauma from assault and i fear relationships and friendships
""
in the same time i am spiritual like ive never been i truly think things on a spiritual plane now which i just never have before likeive witnessed an emotional spectrum in myself that i never knew i had for this i am grateful i swear some days ive experienced higher levels of consciousness after meditation where my issues begin to seem crystal clear unfortunately this does not hold
""
anyways my main point is i am absolutely fine some days some days i meditate and have complete crystal clarity over my situation no obsessions happy etc
""
other days like today the suffering comes out i feel pain straight raw pain sometimes it seems like its related to a specific trauma but then i feel pain without thoughts and i just dont know
""
i can barely even describe my headspace nowadays like im absolutely fine im on top of my mental situation but i simply do not understand myself or the way i operate anymore some days i suffer some days im fine some days im inbetween some days i have clarity other days it seems like issues build up and release and its not under my control i cannot control my confidence anymore i am either confident or not it feels as if ive almost lost a sense of control completely and so i do not try to control i simply trust in what is
""
maybe someone can grasp what im attempting to explain but no worries if not im very aware this sounds all over the place
""
edit to add one more key detail i may gain a revelation regarding something go a few weeks in my new headspace and then traumasuffering builds up seems to purge from myself and then ive gained a new revelation and carry on my new way free of suffering until rinse and repeat im suffering again it almost feels as if im constantly changing constantly grasping new understandings and constantly finding new problems which must be fixed i wonder if this is an illusion something my mind just does or i wonder if im healing
""
optimistically i can say that i have improved much compared to say six months agoat least i am used to feelings of despair now it doesnt scare me like it used to im just wondering if anyone can explain this phenomenon

so since a water main broke and its just coming back theyre saying to boil the water before you drink and cook and whatnot i was wondering if its safe to take a shower with this kind of water or if i should be worried about taking a shower with it
""
what if it accidentally gets in mouth or nose
""
also what about washing hands and utensils

water looks clear
ive had a hemorrhoid for about 2 weeks now its only really became an issue about 4 days ago when i try to use the bathroom its extremely painful it also makes it hard to wipe so usually i just take a shower after should i go see the doctor during this pandemic i live in a hotel right next to an international airport in virginia so im thinking its not such a good idea

ive been on a generic bc currently trilosprintec for ortho tri cyclen norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol since january 2019 since starting my acne has cleared up ive gained about eight pounds could be unrelated but not much has changed in my dietexercise habits havent really changed since starting it my period has become perfectly regular wasnt really on a cycle before and would sometimes go for two months then come back much worse and my brain has been seriously strangulated i think could be unrelated to the bc and instead the result of worseningdepression the pros have largely outweighed the cons for me for awhile but the possibleeffects of the bc on my moodthought processesgeneral sense of being makes me want to go off of it however i dont know how to know if the brainchanges are linked to the bc without going off of it and im worried that the side effects of going off could be worse than staying on especially if the bc isnt whats causing my brain to shut down i know its different for everyone but what can i expect from going off should i just stay on it i know i could have it much worse as far as side effects go and i dont want to take that for granted
""
additionally in the longterm i would like to be on bc and ideally would like to continue taking a pill over other methods are there any other pills that i might respond better to

""
ive been taking ice cold showers and using frozen peas on the itchiest spots my entire body head to toe is itchy i mean including my labia in the shells of my ears between my fingers etc the worst being my stomach legs butt and recently my back near my armpits and i dont know what to do im writing this in tears because im so uncomfortable i wake up with bloody from scratching in my sleep i get colorless bumps on my skin when i finally give in and scratch but i think its just from irritating my skin so badlyhttpsimgurcomaknqheb3ive had no change in diet soaps detergents activity hygiene regular medications etc im at a loss i want to be tested for cholestasis again because im scared it was wrong and will cause complications to my pregnancy
""
im meeting with a dermatologist tomorrow for advice but its a video conference so i dont know how helpful it will be hopefully she has some ideas does anyone have any ideas on what else this could be and how i can relieve this

hey so 24f 98kg 5ft 7 and currently using a vape pen to stop smoking not a massive drinker anymore but will occasionally binge drink when i get going not drank anything in about six weeks
""
so ive been on nights yesterday at about 6pm i woke up with incredible burning pain when i peed and could barely leave the toilet without feeling the need to again classic uti symptoms basically i struggled all last night and into the morning
""
i called my gp when i started getting pain in my sides as well as i was worried it could be a kidney infection theyve prescribed me a short course of antibiotics
""
so i took my first tablet at about 6pm and im meant to take then 12 hours apart its about 330am here now so im due my next one at 6am
""
my question is could i take a my second dose now im bad at waking up when i go to sleep and done want to miss a dose by a loads of hours
i remember reading a while back that depo causes weight gain related to effects on the area of the brain responsible for cravings making it more difficult for people to control their food consumption
it is my understanding that the part of the brain responsible for food cravings is also responsible for alcohol cravings and impulse control
so i am wondering if depo could possibly increase cravings for alcohol in someone who is not alcohol dependent
""
""
""
side note i do have underlying anxiety amp depression which i totally understand are a contributing factor to why i might crave alcohol or be drinking more than usual lately i take accountability for my own drinking and choices but am wondering if the depo shot might make it more difficult in any way or have any affect on moodimpulse control in general which goes hand in hand with drinking

 female 27 years old 120 lbs 5 ft tall 2 years ago i was 280 lbs drugs along w an abusive marriage led me to shedding all the weight in 6 months heavy drug background smoke daily since 2016 been to prison twice for only 6 months each time other than drug induced issues i have relatively no medical history other than severe asthma when i born until i was 18 years old i take no daily prescribed medications i do recreationally use or did which i explain more in the story
""
i went into the er a few days ago because long story short i am a heroin addict who is currently trying very hard to quit but a few days ago i went to my boyfriends house who is also an addict and i get there and he is in an insane amount of pain i knew he wasnt in withdrawal because he had plenty of what he needed to get him through the night i had actually expected to show up to his house and him still have something left for both of us to get well that morning yes a miserable existence but it is my current situation also this is the last time i put a needle in my arm well he didnt have anything and seemed to be in withdrawal so much so that he couldnt even really tell me what was wrong so after assessing the situation for a minute i get out a subutex make it up for him and try to get him to calm down enough to do it i did this because for some reason he had said he felt like he was in precipitated withdrawal and it was the only thing we had at the time
""
well at this point i have nothing to get me well and he is at a point where he seems somewhat ok after i massaged his calves to calm him for a second so i end up doing the leftovers of his shots from the night before cottons as we call it
""
15 minutes after doing these cottons im in the same exact unbearable amount of pain it felt specifically like precipitated withdrawal
hurting legs violent puking clammy skin fever shaking uncontrollably cold that old chestnut i really wish i wasnt this familiar with the feeling of withdrawal but i go through it more often than id like to admit
""
well after assuming that whatever was in his can of cottons had made us sick i decide that i have got to get to the er this pain was no where near normal withdrawal levels it was literally so unbearable i couldnt move from the fetal position to call a ride typically its very flu like not so much completely debilitating
""
at this point i had assumed it was one of a few things 1 cotton fever 2 the cottons had sat in water too long and maybe developed bacteria of some sort andor the can had rust in it which really concerned me or 3 some substance or pill residue had been in the can or on the h when it was initially made this happened to us last year when we accidentally shot up serequil residue truly painful not to mention completely idiotic 
""
anyway i get to the er and they clearly arent stoked to see someone that isnt concerned about having the coronavirus which i completely understand because i cannot imagine working in any type of medical profession at this point in time but none the less i really tried to wait until i felt like i genuinely could not wait any longer the longer i waited the worse it got anyway they do all the normal things blood pressure heart rate questions about my medical history i was honest with them about the drugs well w what i could get out i didnt divulge what had happened right before i came because i genuinely fell out halfway into talking to them they saw my fucked off veins and i told them i was an addict that was in the process of trying to quit id go days clean then use and repeat but couldnt get out the whole story about the cotton shot well they eventually get my iv in i was in and out of reality then ran some tests gave me a cat scan and in the end told me that the pain i was in was unrelated but that i had a 6cm x 5cm teratoma tumor above my left kidney when the doctor told me about it he told me it was super common and that i just needed to go see a urologist but kinda left me hanging which i mean i assume they thought i was there to get drugs so i cant blame them i know that happens a lot even if i truly wasnt and never asked for narcotics doesnt change the stigma
""
i digress
""
i tried to google what the fuck this thing is but all i have really gotten is a bunch of bullshit that honestly my brain is having trouble processing they told me it looked benign and that the spot it was in a particularly unusual spot but to make sure i try to get it removed as soon as possible problem is i just got out of prison in december on an ankle monitor i relapsed and now im trying to reel myself back in but truth be told the last thing on my mind is obtaining any type of health insurance my question being how serious is this should i be concerned is this something that could be cancerous or can turn cancerous if left untreated for any amount of time i plan on trying to get insurance asap and take care of it i just dont know what the realistic timeline of that is is this a major surgery i start a new job may 17th and im really really worried about having to take off any time at all for this its been a long time since ive been able to work an actual job so im really trying to not fuck this up its also a big requirement to keep my monitor on and stay out of prison i know nothing about these tumors other than they can grow teeth and hair and just weird shit like that
""
i realize my lifestyle is not a healthy one i am doing what i can to work on this and havent picked up since this situation happened doesnt seem like much but trust me to some addicts going 12 hours is a fucking miracle i was at that point a few weeks ago i have slowly been trying to switch to suboxonesubutex which is all i have done ever since this shit happened its probably what was needed to completely stop honestly

ive never made a post on here before so i wasnt entirely sure how to go about it hopefully i didnt ramble too much

ive always struggled with my low body bilateral acetabular dysplasia about as flat footed as humanly possible fractured my lower lumbar as a kid and have osteoarthritis now etc

i bought new running shoes a week before quarantine and they were perfect for about 40 days nine or so days ago i cut my toenails fairly short and when i returned from my walk i had a very large blister on my big toe its on the upper inside corner of the nail and continues to the front of the toe
""
no big deal blisters arent life threatening at first it was clear and after a couple days its turned into what now looks like a blood blister
""
i continued walking everyday since over 70 miles this month and this mammoth of a blister still has not popped nine days later
""
its begun to itch now and i want to pop it however i can hear my mothers voice screaming in the back of my head to leave it alone and how it isnt advised and can lead to infection etc
""
dr google says to leave it if feasible
""
medical professionals of redditshould i pop this blister if not how much longer do you think i can reasonably expect to have this thing

primary complaint i have pain that comes and goes periodically during the day it feels like pins and needles above the hip after a week now it seems to be on the rear back or the front side of the right hip taking ibuprofen didnt seem to help i took 400mg this morning and it still appeared after an hour they come momentarily and last for a second or two its light pin and needle pain been going on about since april 20th pain is neither increasing or truly going away
""
i saw a doctor at a walk in clinic and is what they asked and what i said and their conclusion
""
diet relatively clean sometimes i eat junk food social drinker but probably 30 drinks per year on average i dont binge drink
""
urinationstool normal no pain or blood
""
recent activities that might have caused this the only thing i can think of is pulling out my mountain bike and going down hill due to the shock
""
history this happened to me once in 2017 and i thought it was appendicitis when i walked into the walk in clinic the old dude told me to bend over and i did he scoffed and told me its nothing it just went away
""
any impaired movement i can still run 5ks or cycle just fine
""
what have i done to treat it i tried rolling it and googling hip and lower back stretches have been doing them im not sure but i think i aggrevated it more right side by hip generally feels more tight when im doing stretches
""
doctor concluded it was something that needed physiotherapy and told me to take ibuprofen 400mg x 3 so max dose on advil packaging for 5 days

prompted by an irregular pulse i had my mum go to the dr uk gp last week for examination and 12 lead ecg
""
the ecg is here
httpsimgurcomaoocalxh
""
not related to her irregular pulse which seems to have been premature atrial contractions that i dont believe are related to this issue i see signs of left axis deviation on this ecg i am a final year medical student
""
however the dr has reported through the practice secretary that the bloods and ecg were standard and there is no further action required
""
my mum has not experienced any obviousworsening symptoms but does have breathlessness on quite mild exertion which has been for the last couple years she is on blood pressure medication 20mg telmisartan od and levothyroxine and a short course of lomeprazole 30mg od 4 weeks for reflux
""
i have been monitoring blood pressure at least twice a day and she averages around 1351409095 in the day but can raise to 15595 at rest in the evening this was reported to the gp at our consultation
""
should she not be put on some more aggressive blood pressure medication i plan on arranging a phone appointment with her tomorrow to help address these concerns particularly as the ecg does not look normal to me and i do not think her bp control is satisfactory
""
should she also really be referred to cardiologist in the uk referrals have to go through a primary care gp at their request  but obviously he has not yet seen a need for this
""
saying that though i am just a medical student and would greatly appreciate a second opinion

for a few years my shoulders would hurt but usually only when i did things like heavy lifting or raised my arms above my head i went to the doctor they diagnosed me with a torn ligament and sent me to pt but it didnt help once i stopped gymnastics the pain when my away but my shoulders were weak
""
i started going to a massage therapist about a year and a half ago two different people and they commented about the tightness in my shoulders i generally tried to avoid massages there because the entire area felt like a giant pressure point however the therapists were able to massage it in a way that didnt cause too much pain

ever since then ive had a throbbing pain in my shoulders and it just keeps getting worse like the area is on fire the pain is mainly on my right side upper back to the left of my shoulder blade its been killing me lately and i dont know what i can do to make it better i dont like going to doctors because nothing gets solved but pain killers arent working and im tired of it

from images online it seems to be the back part of the parietal bone i fractured on the right side i saw a doctor about it at the time who didnt do any scans but said it would heal on its own along with the pcs symptoms i was having so i went on my merry way and havent had too many issues since although its safe to say it took about a year for my concussion symptoms to go away
""
my question is when covid19 is over and my doctor is accepting nonessential visits again would it be worth asking questions and perhaps requesting xrays or scans to make sure the depressed fracture doesnt cause me any troubles down the road or am i overthinking
""
i can definitely still feel the mild crater ridges the impact created all those years ago and am wondering about the longterm risks of living with a depressed skull fracture
""
further details
""
i did not pass out upon impact and did not seek immediate medical attention again very stupid until the doctors visit i mentioned perhaps a week after the incident i was not inebriated at the time in keeping with rule 1 ill include that i am currently 511 about 210 lbs caucasian i dont smoke cigarettes quit since 2017 but i drink on occasion no recreational drugs and i take pretty good care of my body by taking vitamins exercising and eating right

i am a cancer survivor since december 2018 cancer was a synovial sarcoma tumour in my left arm treated successfully with topical radiation and surgery

hi there

i am a 30yearold woman who has suffered from a long string of supposedly hormonerelated symptoms since puberty i have seen several endocrinologists all who diagnosed me with pcos say they cant explain my more irregular symptoms but tell me not to worry about them and send me on my way i am wondering if there is the possibility of something more going on i weigh 55kg at present and am 161cm tall i have fallen pregnant twice but havent gone through with the pregnancies apparently no hypothyroidism and no diabetes
""
my typical symptoms
""
 irregular periods sometimes painful have been years without menstruating currently getting period every two weeks
 male pattern hirsutism was classed as severe however i have had thousands of dollars of laser hair removal and is now somewhat reduced hair still returns on my upper back faceneck and buttocks irrespective of laser treatment
 hormonal acne
 extreme mood swings and severe insomnia which appears to be cyclical
 cysts on ovaries
 issues with weight lossmanagement at my highest i have been 75kg to lose weight i have to reduce my calories to below 1200cal per day
""
my less than typical symptoms
""
 severe melasma on the upper lip
 constant slight lactation from one breast for the past 6 years have been tested for prolactinoma and breast abnormalities both with negative results
 hypertrophied inner labia currently 6cm and apparently progressing
 tubular breasts
 darkened patches of skin around the groin
 osteopenia diagnosed in my last bmd test with subsequently elevated levels of blood calcium consistently
 moderate vitamin d deficiency
""
unrelated medical issues
""
 factor v leiden deficiency
 congenital acetabular femoral impingement and have been recommended for surgery to repair a torn labrum
 hypermobile joints and some skin hyperelasticity not enough to diagnose as ehlersdanlos
 add for which i am medicated with dexamphetamine
 long term issues with depressionsuicidal tendencies which i personally attribute to my health issues
 idiopathic urticaria
 scoliosis
""
treatment so far
""
 lifestyle changes low carb diet laser hair removal etc
 implanon several times  discontinued
 spironolactone 100mg for hirsutism and acne for 2 years which led to elevated liver enzyme levels edema and dehydration issues during this time my period stopped completely but my doctors believed this was due to malnutrition when trying to lose weight discontinued
 currently metformin 200mg per day for the past 6 weeks  again to regulate the period and reduce hirsutismacne was decided to try this instead of spironolactone
""
i have asked for a most recent blood test panel copy to post here  should be available tomorrow the consensus seems to be elevated prolactin is stressrelated most hormone levels are within normal range testosterone is only slightly elevated consistently high levels of blood calcium isnt necessarily cause of concern
""
i understand pcos causes the majority of my symptoms however the genital abnormalities constant lactation and melasma cause me to think that there could be something else going on could it be just a particularly unfortunate case of pcos or something more i understand there is probably not a treatment to reverse some of my symptoms however a definitive diagnosis beyond its probably related to your pcos would be of much relief to me

finally i appreciate whoever has taken the time to read this post

hi there i am increasingly worried i may have colon cancer i know its becoming more prevalent in younger people and im reading a lot of scary stuff
""
i have had rectal bleeding on and off for several months but consistently the last month sometimes its in the water other times on the surface of stool and sometimes on toilet paper when i wipe its always bright red only saw a clot once and not even sure it was a clot i dont have any pain but a feeling of pressure and having to go sometimes but i am somewhat constipated and straining more than usual im also gassy and have some low back ache no stomach pains nausea or anything like that
""
i made an appt with a gi doctor who did a rectal exam with his finger and then a small scope and he said he didnt see any hemorrhoids but a good amount of mucus ironically stopped bleeding for a week at this point of course so maybe i had hemorrhoid and it went away he scheduled a colonoscopy to explore which im grateful for
""
elective surgeries are still on the fence due to covid its been several weeks and now the bleeding is back should i panic colon cancer how likely is it fuck im scared no family history of colon cancer my dad had one polyp once when he was young and it was benign everyone is healthy i know im very overweight but im athletic and i seriously look like 170 im a size 12 but im dieting and working on it

i posted on here awhile ago the first time my perineum got torn but i didnt get any responses basically after sex with my partner that was rougher than usual i felt pain and burning in the vaginal area and when i looked at the area in a mirror i saw two about 12 inch lacerations in the perineal area
""
since i wasnt sure what to do i looked around online and all i could find was to ice the area keep it clean of course and stay away from sex and rigorous exercise for at least a few days
""
the tears did close up on their own seemingly and the area felt better so a couple of days later i thought that i was fine my partner and i had sex again and the area tore again so i did the same thing ice cleaning it etc and we decided to wait for at least two weeks this time even if it feels fine
""
now we have not had sex since and the perineal tears have healed but for some reason there is now a tear in my labia majora it appeared a few days ago and seemed to go away but it is not back today it is a much smaller tear but it is still burning and painful
""
i dont know what to do about this or why these tears keep occurring especially since i am not engaging in any type of penetrative sex or anything

any help would be so so so appreciated thank you

ive donated blood twice both times i had intense nausea and got lightheaded no vomiting though so i still go but i looked into my vitals and found that my hemoglobin was 158 in in feb 2019 and 164 in sept 2020 i didnt know what that is or meant but looked interesting so i googled and found that its higher than usual for an adult female 152 is what i read to be the high end for an adult female

ive always suspected i was anemic because ive been mostly vegan for a few years and always been a fainter intense heat locked knees headaches rooms with bad circulation you name it im the first one down but my hemoglobin levels are the opposite of anemic

ive done plenty of googling and think my symptoms align with polycythemia vera random itchiness exhaustion attention loss and red dots on my skin obviously they could be anything or nothing but its enough to concern my nurse stepmother

on march 19th i was scratched by my dog on feet it was a minor scratch with just blood visible but no bleeding out i washed it with dettol and water after 34 days i started feeling some stiffness and pain in the neck i got really worried about tetanus as my last show was around 12 years ago i also started getting some random numbness in the legs later on started getting minor muscle twitches on arms legs and buttocks around that time i talked to a doctor on phone due to covid19 lockdown and he said that if it were tetanus i would have got a fever i had no fever so i let it go
from last week ive been having some jaw pain mostly on one side i feel it near my ear and sometimes i feel pressure in the ear as well headache near eyebrow and sensitivity in teeth i have some mini jaw spasms and muscle twitches near lips eyebrow and neck i dont have stiffness in the jaw or neck i can still turn the neck around and open jaw without extreme pain except for the one on the side and near temples the muscle twitches continue they go away if i move the limb or rub it i still dont have a fever its been like 40 days since the scratch is there any possibility of this being tetanus or is it some other disease i am really worried and anxious couldnt even get proper sleep not because of pain but thinking over it
additional details around that time in the march i traveled from my work city to hometown so my diet changed quiet a lot even the quality of water of i drink been drinking hard water idk if this is relevant

im a 28 year old man and ive been having very bad back issues for about 5 months now and have been seeing doctors to try and diagnose it since i recently had an mri done on the lumbar area that shows no disc or nerve issues yet i have all the symptoms of disc problems my doctor says it rare to have thoracic disc herniation and we shouldnt mri that section just yet ive had manageable back problems for about 10 years now where i initially had a herniated disc when it started mri and xray show no reason why i should be having these issues next i will be getting blood work done to look for some type of arthritis

so about 4 months ago i had a big injury from simply stretching in which my back went fully into spasm where i could not move or use any muscle in the back for about 12 days and could only begin walking again about 4 days after the incident since then ive been slowly exercising and getting better but ive been in a cycle of doing fine then having some level of paindiscomfort or spasms that prevents me from exercising for a few days my average days are very uncomfortable

has anyone had similar issues any idea what it could be should i push my doctor to have my thoracic area mrid thanks for any help as i am becoming increasingly frustrated with finding no reason why i am experiencing these issues

im male and 16yo and about a year ago i went to a theme park and got a virus that the doctors never identified i was sick for 2 weeks and before that i was having a lot of panic attacks and anxiety ever since then i got a pain in my muscles in the back of my head and neck that spread to my body over time within the next few months i developed a whole lot of weird symptoms including widespread muscle pain tingling muscle spasms and twitches nerve pain in my limbs and fingers burning feelings in my muscles cold hands and feet and sensitivity to cold cold sweats restless legs and brain fog and slight memory loss ive went to a few doctors and got a lot of blood tests for lupus sexually transmitted diseases cbc and vitamin deficiencies but they all came back fine my great grandpa and cousin have ms so im going to get an mri to rule that out but i feel like its not that because i havent lost eyesight and i dont have weakness im thinking fibromyalgia but i want other opinions
im 22 years old f and have struggled with generalized anxiety disorder since i was 16 ive noticed that my stress levels have spiked since this health crisis started and ive tried to attribute my thoughts and feelings to that but i have a question for this sub thats been nagging me lately 
lately including as i type this ive been feeling a vibratingfluttering in my chest usually after an anxiety attack my heart rate is 70 bpm as im laying in bed but im trying to say its due to anxiety i should also note that im not experiencing any tightness maybe a mild dull ache along my inner right breast but not whole chest tightness or pain but im worried about falling asleep and something bad happening admittedly im a hypochondriac when it comes to my heart especially but i wanted to ask if this fluttering feeling seems like its purely anxietyrelated or something potentially serious because with my heightened levels of anxiety lately it feels like its always there mostly at night before bed and not like brief palpitations
im seeing my new pcp tomorrow after not having one for a little over a year due to an insurance change but i wanted to get some opinions from anyone knowledgeable in heart health before i visit this doctor to perhaps assuage my worry id also be lying if i said i wasnt worried about dying in my sleep from what i could be passing off as an anxiety symptom and of course i hope that doesnt happen
for the past 8 months i have experienced pain while touching my temple on the left side of my face it can be from any touch like brushing my hair out of the way facial expressions or sometimes the wind the pain is described like a sharp shooting sensation i frequently cannot lay on that side of my face due to the pressure and pain it extends from the hair line by my temple to behind my left eye when grazedtouched no facial paralysis or dropping associated i do experience tension headaches about 2 times a week i usually treat them with excedrine

with covid screenings making the news and scanning temps of crowds to identify fever it got me wondering if i did have a fever would it be flagged by imaging my body temp has been as low as 956 in recent months ive gone years and years without checking and even when i had fevers i didnt or couldnt check my temp so theres that ignorance 20 years ago my temp was around 97 37 years ago i spent a week in an army hospital with a fever as high as 1035 they never told me what i had or what an injection was it hurt i think my temp was average back then

im 38m medical history is very long ask what you want but details are history of addiction especially alcoholism but some other legal overthecounter medicines huge tolerance to diphenhydramine poor health choices all around eventual severe tbi currently seriously sleep problems and boredom due to covid i have access to weed and extra trazodone and i felt like seeing what would happen medicine keppra amantadine gabapentin for sleep too antidepressants
""
at 3am yesterday technically today after being awake for about 13 hours i took 800mg of trazodone on a relatively empty stomach i went to bed because i figured thats safer when i literally overdose and i laid there for an hour wide awake feeling nothing wearing cpap i got bored and got up to cook food and watch tv oh and vaped an excessive amount of nicotine weed was involved too a few hours later i took i think 500mg more of trazodone and went back to bed still bored i think i laid there for a long time feeling nothing and feel asleep at like 9am
""
i found this quote in the movie silver linings playbookhttpsiimgurcom4y4sdwxjpg

were the characters talking about even more trazodone than i took seriously this is all 100 true i have great doctors but no one seems to believe it or answer me how can i be this dangerously immune to feeling the effect of an overdose

the same nothing feeling has happened before taking at least 12 vicodin at once 15 benadryl oh lol recently 3 xanax with like 6 hydroxyzine and yeah felt finally calm pretty severe anxiety though dont remember how i felt when weed got involved a few hours later

my sos 39m elbow swole up pretty big last night seemingly out of nowhere googling indicates its likely elbow bursitis it looks just like that its squishy and slightly red and off and on a little warm to the touch but not hot no fever no pain except with certain movements ie mousing on the computer today he said he could feel it a little no sign of a scratch or anything on the surface no injury except two years ago when he remembers falling on that elbow but nothing ever came of that at the time hes in otherwise good health 6 ft 160lbs non smoker
""
our concern is whether it is infected or notobviously we want to avoid going to the dr in the middle of a pandemicdoes the slight warmth of the elbow definitely mean infection or could a non infected bursitis also be a little warm
""
is it safe to continue with rest ice elevation ibuprofen and see if that helps it or is the chance that its infected too great not to go to a dr how long canshould we self treat before going to a dr how to know when we definitely should go to the doctor

i was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia earlier today after some chest xrays and i wanted to know how long typically it should take for antibiotics for this kind of pneumonia take to kick in due to what is happening globally i do not want to be too late if it turns out to be something else i cant remember the name of the antibiotic itself nor do i really want to get out of bed i was not tested for covid19
""
i had been on a different antibiotic for around a week due to a suspected sinus infection then everything seemed to move down into my chest it burns when i breathe and i have had a constant low grade fever for nearly 2 weeks i just want this to be over with how long will this last when i start the new antibiotic tomorrow and if it doesnt really kick in during that timeset should i go to the doctor again

sometimes my blood sugar will spike up well above 200 mgdl for 1 or 2 hours after a meal and then come back to normal again most of the time its in the 80s while fasting and often only spikes to around 150 and then is back under 120 at 2 hours it seems to just randomly spike above 200 every so often after not a lot of carbs im worried that it could be an early sign of impaired glucose tolerance but people seem to think that im just being a hypochondriac because im young and healthy any thoughts

title says almost everything my bf took ativan and prozac in the past but weaned off and has been med free for a few years in that time he has since moved and stopped seeing that previous doctor who made those prescriptions
""
now hes having some severe workquarantinerelated anxiety and he wants to get represcribed meds however since he moved and changed health insurance a year ago he did that thing where you just choose any random pcp in the area who is currently accepting new patients so he has never actually met his currently assigned pcp
""
what would be the best course of action to get meds as quickly as possible since ativan is a benzo would he be perceived as medseeking by discussing this with his new pcp
""
or would it be possible to schedule a telehealth appointment with his previous doctor without having them as an assigned pcp

im 18f and otherwise healthy i had one four loko today and vomited bright red blood i didnt vomit forcefully or for a long time and the blood came quickly so i dont suspect a tear caused from extensive retching i dont drink often maybe a beer or two on weekends the last time i really drank was 3 weeks ago when i had a lot hard liquor special occasion what im trying to say is i dont consider myself a binge drinker and this has never happened to me before in fact this is my first time vomiting from alcohol before as i have a strong stomach when it comes to drinking the only other thing is i sometimes use cocaine though not for four days now and not in excessive amounts that is the only drug i use im really scared about the blood because when i google drinking vomiting blood or cocaine vomiting blood everything that comes up tells me i have an irreparable liver condition caused by alcoholism or extensive cocaine abuse the thing is i dont think i drink enough for that to be the case and i dont do coke enough either i also havent experienced any other symptoms that align with liver failure or anything like that with covid going on rn i would prefer not to visit a doctor until i absolutely have to are there any other possible causes of vomiting blood is it possible to vomit blood after drinking without underlying conditions

about two weeks ago i woke up with a funny feeling in my ear and ending up going and getting it checked out got an ear infection and was given some antibiotics motrin and tylenol for swelling and pain relieving i started to have some really bad bowel issues most notably the first two days after i had some very runny diarrhea then couple days later some pain around my anus when i would poop went to check up with the doctor and he said it seemed fine and i could come off the meds to alleviate the bowel issues and i did felt better over the course of 34 days then couple days ago i started have issues where my stomache would start feeling queezy but not that i wanted to throw up but where i needed to poop and it felt bad enough to where i would go and it would feel better but it started happening a lot like almost once every two hours sometimes twice an hour noticed my stool was slightly green and so i googled with the only results saying it could be from diet change antibiotics or operation procedures well ive not gotten any operating procedures and while my diet is a mix of fast food and healthy food i tried to eat more healthy and get some probiotics mostly yogurt in my diet to help with my gut health nothing has helped and im wondering if i need to go back in or wait a couple more days to see if it starts getting better

""
as of the later half of last year i have sporadically gotten swollen feet and ankles after coming out of the shower but it has been almost chronic in the past month
ive been to the doctor for this before and he told me it was probably because i shower too hot but at this point i have oedema even when i skip a shower ive been tested on diabetes before and my blood pressure has always been pretty regular
""
placing my feet on a high surface does not seem to work for me and working out doesnt do a lot either fasting for a day does seem to work as well as compression as whenever i have been wearing shoes for a little while the oedema will stay away for a few hours
""
i am wondering if it maybe has anything to do with my kidneys since ive always been someone that does not pee a lot 13 times per day despite how much i drink i do stay pretty active and i am currently eating very healthy as i am on a weight loss journey
""
if anyone has any clue as to what it could be or what i could do i would love to know

for the past 6 months or so ive experienced myopia in my left eye only got glasses for itright eye normal and sporadic numbness in my left foot to the point that ive tripped on it and im worried is it something neurological how long is it ok to wait to go to doctors given covid

what could be causing these symptoms are they normal ive never heard of someone developing nearsightedness in only one eye and the foot numbness freaks me out

during this time ive also had swollen lymph nodes on the left side of my neck and one on the back of my neck i doubt they are related though

tonight after changing my son into his jammies i noticed this bruise or rash on his back almost looks like a large hickey he doesnt seem to be uncomfortable i dont think it itches and doesnt have a fever he did go to sleep about an hour earlier than he normally does im concerned it might be a bruise from daycare but can also could just be some type of irritation from his clothing i live in arizona and the temperature is now in the hundreds so maybe a heat rash but again it does it appear to be itchy and it is not raised nor is there any type of texture

hi i am 21 years old and i am experiencing a discomfortslight pain in my right lungchest and i will occasionally blow my nose and there will be bloody chunks and odd colors blackish yellowish brownish and reddish i am healthy and workoutlift 56 days a week i have not noticed any noticeable effect on my performance in the gym the symptoms have been going on for about 67 months now without it getting worse or better
""
i went in about 3 months ago to get the symptoms looked at the doctor did the preliminary test of checking breathing heart rate etc they did not notice anything wrong but i insisted on getting the x ray and blood work done sure enough they diagnosed me with a mild bronchitis they gave me the z pak inhaler and cold medicine
""
after completing the antibiotic course cold medicine etc i noticed a little bit of improvement but not much i continued on with the slight discomfort for about another 12 months then i decided to go in again because the original symptoms never went away once again they looked at me strange when the preliminary tests came back normally i insisted that they run another x ray and do the blood work this time everything came back normal and the original bronchitis went away
""
now i am wondering what is wrong with me i am planning on investigating this further as it is starting to concern me considering how long the symptoms have persisted if it is potentially something really bad i want to catch it before it does serious damage or gets worse can any of you shed some light on the illnesscondition i have if there is one thank you

complaint my daughter has had about cold and fever 6 times in last 7 months and every time she had cold she almost had ear infection last month she had flu and immediately after the flu she had constant runny nose without fever so doctor suggested antihistamine suspecting allergy
""
a couple of weeks ago she was very fussy and she was exhibiting symptoms of an ear infectionfussy in the night and day low grade temp apetite was gone we were not sure but doctor prescribed the antibiotic for that we used it and her fever has gone down and she was not fussy after that for about a couple of days
""
now she has a low grade fever for about 5 days and she is still on antibiotics she has a fever between 995999f consistently doctors say that the toddlers usually have that kind of temp and nothing to worry about
""
im not sure if we are ignoring any underlying issue here is it normal to have that temperature even after taking antibiotics please let me know i might be overthinking but need a second opinion on this

bug bite
so earlier today i started feeling a mild burning pain on my ring finger and thought maybe i scratched myself or something a few minutes after i noticed it the pain started to get worse and worse it flared up and felt like it was burning it feels like how a flesh wound feels when you put alcohol on it or similar to burning yourself with boiling hot water stings and burns is the best way i can describe the pain im feeling
ive had zero other symptoms besides when i first felt the pain i also felt a similar pain in my armpit but that cleared up after 30 or so minutes
i went out to get some sunlight and took the picture linked here
ouchhttpsprntscs7rrzh so instantly i figures well there are spiders in my room and my window is open with a garden right next to it maybe a bug bite i inspected the area but saw absolutely no bite marks
""
gradually i started to notice swelling and in an hour or so i noticed that my ring finger had gotten really puffy and pink with the same type of pain went to work did some very light work to avoid having to use my ring finger and the burning pain has been pretty constant
""
im back home and the swelling of the finger has looked down for hours now but the burning pain is still there it doesnt hurt to the touch ibuprofen doesnt help ice packs seem to make the pain worse washing in hot water feels good at first but as soon as i take it out the pain feels searing like if i poured alcohol over a wound the yellow mark pictured is now gone and my finger looks normal again but the pain is still there
""
i dismissed a bug bite because of no marks but what could it possibly be pain is pretty bad to be honest but there are no other symptoms such as fever abdominal pain fatigue or anything else been 8 hours since first noticed at this point
i have a long history of severe seasonal allergies reflux amp tmj for about a year maybe 2 ive been getting chronic pain which i can only describe as feeling like a needle piercing my eardrum there are also times when my ear feels full i have tried both baby oil amp peroxide to see if it helped but it hasnt my doctor says she can see nothing wrong when she looks in my ear i want to note that due to my allergies there are times when my ear canalthroat can get really itchy but what ive been experiencing the last 2 months is different i get a sensation in my ear which causes me to itch with my pinky in my ear canal however what now happens is that if i touch my ear canal in this way my throat on the same side gets a sensation that causes me to cough amp gag i do have large tonsils amp get tonsil stones but i dont see a stone anywhere i dont have this issue with my other ear or throat side any ideas what could be causing this amp how to cure it

this past month shes been vomiting every week or every three days whenever her mom took her to a doctor they didnt know what was wrong with her so they just gave her antivomiting pills
""
""
a little over a week ago she just kind of fainted and her body wouldnt move they took her to a hospital and on their way there her body started shaking very badly when she arrived at the hospital and took tests there was nothing wrong with her but she kept shaking every two or three hours so they gave her medication for it
""
""
they told us because of the shaking there was some water accumulated on her brain at this point she was on life support she couldnt breathe on her own they were gonna give her medication so that the water accumulated would go out through urine but they told us they couldnt give her those pills until shes able to breathe on her own
""
""
her body was swelling and none of her veins were showing so they couldnt give her glucose for a while she took milk through a tube through her nose and yesterday her body wouldnt digest the milk so they havent given her anything till now
""
""
her body is really swelling up and there were some blood clots in her legs
theyre telling us theyre gonna take her off of life support cuz there wasnt anything they could do for her

this story begins right after the new year of 2019 im single feeling lonely get on tinder and match with a girl talk for a few days and end up getting a hotel room we had sex twice with condoms and between each time we talked we got to an agreement that we would be friends with benefits so we could have sex unprotected so long as we were honest and didnt sleep around with other people newsflash this is dumb always use protection with people youve known less than a week so we have sex a third time unprotected fast forward about 12 hours its early january my urethra is itching and i have white discharge coming out of my penis i go to urgent care thinking i have a uti or the beginnings of one it feels similar ive had a uti before even though they are rare in men i see the doctor he tells me i have symptoms that look a lot like chlamydia we do a urine and blood test for all of the common stis all negative he still gives me a single azithromycin and a 7 once a day doxycyclines and told me i should be fine in a couple of weeks
""
i didnt talk much to the girl i hooked up with but i told her i was having symptoms of an sti and would keep her updated long story short she freaked out and tried to make me feel guilty and project a bunch of self image issues onto me i recommend she go get tested and she told me she was blocking me i didnt feel like it was a very mature response i take everything as prescribed on the first day the discharge is worse then it goes to basically nothing but not completely going away after my prescription is done i still have mild itching in my urethra and glans i have a clear sticky discharge that will end up sealing the meatus of my penis if i go a few hours without urinating once or twice a day i will have a sharp sting from inside my urethra it feels like something is weakly biting it
""
about a month passes its now early february 2019 nothing has really changed i call my doctor schedule an appointment and get a physical and all of the blood tests while im at it another full sti panel everything comes back negative i explain my past visit to urgent care symptoms medications i took he suggests i see a urologist im like great lets get to the bottom of this except it takes 3 months every time i schedule an appointment with him its now the end of may 2019 i see the urologist i pee in a cup and they send it off for a urinalysis they tested for all the stis related to urine test and now for ureaplasma spp and mycoplasma hominis all results negative the only odd thing was i had trace amount of blood in my urine he says the medication i was prescribed was a bit of an old school method and recommended we do an injection of ceftriaxone rocephin in the butt and a single dose of azithromycin sounds good but due to a work related event i couldnt get the injection that week so we rescheduled for next week the injection can leave some peoples rear end feeling really tender and my work is very physical i needed to do it on a day off so a week passes i picked up the azithromycin waited until they gave me the injection of rocephin and took the azithromycin within 1015 minutes of the injection the doctor recommended taking both as close as you could so im following his instructions the best i can some time passed i had protected sex with someone in august 2019 this is the only person i have had sex with since january 2019
""
everything is going well for a couple of weeks then the itching comes back the clear discharge comes back and its an every day occurrence at this point i make another appointment with a urologist this appointment is for september 2019 i go in i pee in another cup they go to test it again and now test trichomianis as well all negative again i have trace amount of blood in my urine during the appointment the doctor says if nothing gets resolved lets do an ultrasound of your bladder i set an appointment for an ultrasound with the urologist its for late november i go in get the jelly put on my belly and the nurse takes some ultrasound images of my bladder doctor emails me everything looks normal my symptoms are still bugging me and the urologist is basically telling me at this point that the human body changes the older we get i understand but my urethra should not be itching every day like this my penis should not be sealed shut every time i go to urinate
""
between visits im trying to research these symptoms and figure out other things that are similar to chlamydia but not chlamydia mycoplasma genitalium comes up repeatedly and seems to be the culprit i email the urologist mention it to him and he says that their lab doesnt have a test for it you can get it done but mylabbox cool ill drop the money for it if it points me in the right direction i get it follow the instructions to a t and send it in eagerly waiting the results i get the results a week or two later negative i cant figure out what i have for the life of me
""
around comes december 2019 and i need to get a tb test done for work i go into my physician and mention i want to get another round of sti tests done just in case anything may have popped up he tells me the only one to worry about would be hiv so i get an hiv test done with the tb test in the appointment were talking about my symptoms my concern now is that if i do have something i dont want to pass it on to anyone i would like to date but having something that i dont know what it is makes me feel incredibly self conscious and makes me nervous to date what if we date for a long time and decide to get married have unprotected sex and i give her super aids or something call me paranoid but i dont want to pass anything along
""
its a couple of days before christmas 2019 i make another appointment with the urologist he suggests we do a cystoscopy in february to those who dont know they put a camera down your urethra to see inside all the way to your bladder its about as exciting as you can imagine february comes im nervous as hell covid is becoming a real thing and i have to get a camera shoved down my pee hole they do the cystoscopy and everything goes off without a hitch and everything is normal and healthy according to the doctor leaving me with very little hope of knowing what the hell is going on with me just that your body changes when you get older
""
its been about two months since then and now were at the end of april every test i have taken has come back negative my symptoms still persist urethra still itching weak stinging once to twice a day clear discharge still sealing me shut and feels like im backed up every time i urinate it feels like im peeing out a blockage in my urethra like it takes a second or two for my urine to push everything out before it fills the complete volume of my urethra kind of the same way it feels after ejaculating and having some fluid left inside before urinating it out
""
now that you know the background my questions is what do i do next should i callemail my urologist and tell him im having constant urethritis could it be ngu should i get a higher dose of antibiotics its really killing me on the inside i feel dirty it reminds of what it felt like right before the uti i had got really painful my attention is always on my penis because it hasnt felt normal for over a year straight please any educated advice is welcome

i am 27m dealing with unexplained head pain that cripples me on a daily basis i am in dire need of some advice the pain is most characteristically known as a headache but becomes excruciatingly painful when listening to certain sounds if one of nieces and nephews cries it is enough to ruin my peace of mind for an entire night i figuratively curl into a ball and hold my breath until its over the pain feels like my whole head is rattling and it is very difficult to focus on anything while it is peaking there is a significant amount of pressure in my head while the noise continues but silence allows it to slowly relax i cautiously mention that 7 years ago i went through a traumatic attack where i was put into a choke hold until i almost blacked out i did not previously have issues with sound sensitivity but pain did not occur until at least a few years after so i couldnt determine if this event was related
the other major problem is that my wifes voice has the same effect when she comes over to talk to me about her day if im dealing with any kind of work stress or have my head otherwise focused the instant she starts speaking i have shooting pain throughout my head when she stops talking it immediately dies down but remains in an ache for a few minutes to an hour
in general i would say im very sensitive to noise can detect subtle sounds more readily than most people and am more bothered by loud or unlikeable noises than others i went to get my hearing tested a year ago to see if it could be a sound sensitivity to specific frequencies the ear doctor put me in a silent booth and played at many frequencies but i appeared to have normal levels of tolerance for a person my age ive considered if the issue could be related to misophonia but have no way of diagnosing myself im reaching out because the daily pain is affecting my work relationships and home life i would appreciate any direction on what type of testing i should focus on to identify the cause and any suggestions for improving my condition

ok so to be clear im not a constant drinker i rarely drink but the problem is that when i do drink it can be excessive the last 2 times ive ended up in the hospital its been almost a year since any drinking though i just recently about a week ago got a bit drunk and made sure to only have a 1 12 cups it was bacardi before that though i had also gotten high from cough syrup maybe a few weeks before with dxm only no acetaminophen ever since both of those incidents ive been trying to stay fairly healthy my concern is that ive had a few symptoms since then being
my eyes looked slightly yellow but recently it seems less so
feeling tired i slept for 12 hours last night
bloating
slight abdominal discomfort but not pain
ive always had a little to no appetite so not sure there

i would like to see a doctor but since this pandemic is going on im scared to go and have it turn out to be nothing would just like some opinions please

hi ive had this issue for about a year now where i feel like there is something in the back of my throat my throat doesnt hurt i wouldnt call this sensation itchy and i dont feel mucus sliding down my throat however i do usually have a decent amount of phlegm in the morning which causes some mild irritation of my throat in the morning
""
clearing my throat or swallowing usually makes me want to swallow again because theres that feeling in the back of my throat i know there isnt something physically stuck back there because this has been going on for a year or so now i dont smoke and ive tried claratin mucinex zyrtec and various lozenges and if they work its usually only for a couple hours and then the feeling is back this is a massive nuisance in general it affects my sleep and meditation practice as well any help is appreciated

ive experienced this for about 3 years now and i feel like theres something wrong with me because no one ive talked to has this issue
""
basically i take a drink of something and i hold it in my mouth for 510 seconds before swallowing i feel kind of anxious about choking or someone hearing me swallow sort of hyper aware that i could choke and die plus there are people watching me i do have a history of anxiety and i dont believe there to be anything physically abnormal about my throat
""
kind of silly i know im just trying to get to the bottom of it

im a 26f with geographic tongue or at least thats what i assume i have since ive never been officially diagnosed i read up on the internet which is why i think its geographic tongue
""
time to time my tongue becomes really sensitive and hurts when i eat food especially spicy food i try to stay away but it so good i also think its stressed induced but im not sure when i have episodes of this inflammation my tongue has red patches thats a different texture from rest of the tongue some time the patches are small other times theyre large i also noticed tiny crack this time around
""
i was wondering if any one has this and if you do what do you go or control it i really hate it
hi

pain level coming and going between discomfort and 78 ready to scream started 9pm now 150 am have taken one oxycodone i had left over from my c section two aleve and two benedryl to try to sleep the pain does not seem to be affected by the pain meds more by how the stones are moving as some of the worst pain was like 30 minutes after the oxycodone i realize now this may have started a few days ago as a few days ago i noticed that my belly was bloated and hard like i was pregnant
""
i dont know how much longer i can do this im in real agony unable to sleep but i live in the bronx which is an epicenter for covid and im wary of going to the er and dont even know if its ethical to clog it up right now
""
when should i go what are other options i cannot see myself being able to work in this much pain i work from home any and all advice would be appreciated
""
some history
""
i had my first gall bladder attack 2 years ago after i had my first baby i think it was brought on by rapid weight loss during the pregnancy hyperemesis and immediately following i think all told i lost about 60 lbs over the course of the pregnancy and about 2 months pp and then gained most of it back rapidly once i could eat without vomiting am obese about 250 lbs 59
""
i went to er cuz i thought i was having a heart attack turned out to be gallstones gallbladder mustve unplugged because very rapidly i felt fine sent home with an oxy prescription i actually got filled which i never do and a consult with a gastro which i sadly admit i never followed up on because i was just very frayed post partum and did not want another surgery
""
i think i had an attack 1 or 2 more times didnt take any meds i ate a lot less fat and then literally forgot about it eventually threw out the pain meds
""
fast forward two years another baby another c section more rapid weight loss and regain but not as severe and then about two days ago i noticed my belly was hard and bloated and thought it was just quarantine life and then got a horrible attack while putting my toddler to sleep once again thought it was a heart attack but then remembered what happened before with my gallbladder and the symptoms fit more i do not have an appendix found a pain meds prescription i was given after my most recent c section and took it but i honestly dont know if it had any effect
22f nonsmoking 52 and a healthy weight i frequently get a splotchy rash on my inner arm sometimes the rash covers my entire body worse places are arms butt and legs the rash is not itchy and when it covers my entire body its actually painful and burns usually gets worse after a shower and i do not shower in extremely hot water i have pictures as well
even as i type this im still very shaken some bit of information ive been having allergy symptoms all week like heavy mucus and runny nose basically i was brushing my teeth after taking a shower and while i was finishing up i spat out this very noticeable bit of blood now i thought it could have been from my gums or a small ulcer i have in my mouth one of those ulcers you get due to eating too late into the night but after i checked my mouth nothing was bleeding or irritated i tried to see if i spit out any more but after that instance i have not seen more blood dont know if this tinglepressure in my chest is related or just my anxiety trying to give me a hard time since im prone to panic attacks to put it simply im afraid
beginning in late december i suddenly became very fatigued and unwell leading to a trip to the er with a diagnosis of walking pneumonia and a uti i was treated for both with antibiotics previously i was diagnosed with pandas and the mycoplasma bacteria of the pneumonia triggered a relapse since then i have been experiencing these symptoms on a progressive scale with flare ups it has really affected my ability to be in school deteriorated my mental health and caused me to struggle socially i am desperate for an answer if you notice any patterns reading or have any suggestions please let me know

i am 23f

it has been two years and ive been getting this persistent tingling feeling in my vagina clitoris area i have lost my sex drive and
""
yes i got off anti depressants two years ago took them for 5 months but the tingling sensation is making me feeling like it could be something else and not pssd post ssri sexual disorder
""
i have the following symptoms
""
1 tingling sensation in vaginaclitvulva i honestly dont know where its coming from but putting pressure inside my vulva feels like relief and so does masturbating
""
2 numb genitals they just feel like any other part of my body
""
3 weak orgasm although masturbating is temporary relief my orgasms are super weak now
""
4 no sex drive i dont remember the last time i stopped doing something to mastubrate because i got horny it just never happens
""
5 sex isnt that great anymore there is little pleasure while sex only the first 5 seconds but then later it becomes nothing
""
""
i know most of these symptoms r pssd related but i really want to hope that maybe i have damage in a nerve somewhere so i can get help for it

just wanna start by saying i 18f have endometriosis in case thats at all relevant here  so this is a bit gnarly and detailed so im sorry in advance anyhow about a week ago now i developed this like ingrown hair on my pubic region its very close to my vaginal opening and near my anus in a way its big it started getting really bad to the point where walking hurt and the only sense of relief id get is when in the shower and when putting a warm damp washcloth on it other than that its been causing a lot of pain even some crying in pain its horrible ive been getting a lot of ingrown hairs since the start of the pregnancy but ive been using this cream i bought and have never had one this bad ive been just trying to keep the area clean so it doesnt get worse but tonight when i sat on the toilet there was a lot of blood and i was scared that i lost the baby but then i felt and realized the cyst popped as i sat down and there was a lot of blood and pus and god knows what else my boyfriend poor him helped me clean it up and put some gauze pads on it but its been bleeding its slowed down now for the last several hours and it hurts very very badly what could this be and is there anything i should do ill bring this up at my next obgyn appointment but right now my boyfriend is extremely worried because it will not stop bleeding and he wants me to make a trip to the er i feel its unnecessary but who knows should i be worried too
hi i noticed a bump on my scapha i actually just looked up the real name i wouldve just called it my cartilage about a month or so ago

ive never had my cartilage pierced there so that can be ruled out
""
it seems to slowly be growing and kind of makes the frame of my ear where its growing jut out in almost a little triangle shape imagine like the tip of an elf ear but an inch below the top i would say its about a centimeter in width and possibly height as well
""
it doesnt hurt when i touch it or bend it the part thats growing doesnt seem like it can be moved around so i dont think its an abscess
""
this is my first time posting on this sub so im not sure if i can say dm me for pictures because i have them
""
""
what could it be when things with the pandemic slow down would it be better to see a doctor or dermatologist about this

a few days ago my right ear was really itchy and so stupidly i decided to use my finger to scratch it and i felt something sort of move and its since felt like im wearing an ear plug in my right ear constantly my first thought was that ive pushed wax far down the canal and its become impacted i gently tried using a q tip and there does indeed seem to be a lot of wax i bought some spray that is supposed to break it down and ive used it a couple of times a day for 2 days and its not really helped although the instructions do say use it for 34 days then try and use warm water to flush any wax out

additionally ive been having this weird tight pain in my chest that becomes more noticeable when moving my upper body i doubt its anxiety since laying down or lifting something about the weight of a cat makes it worse it comes and goes randomly

i 31f just got over a dental infection in an upper right molar and minor facial cellulitis a week ago and was on cephalexin then augmentin cephalexin didnt work for quite some time now i was aware of feeling like the right side of my neck felt tighter when id drink anything with my neck extended at a certain degree and angle but not always however i had also had a dental infection for quite some time
""
now that im done with antibiotics im still feeling my lymph node on the right side as double the size of the left one but not painful in the least if anything it feels a little sensitive to the touch depending on how much pressure i apply or wiggle it around ive also had constant crackling in my ears when i swallow for quite some time so i thought it was just allergies and thats why i felt like the side of my neck was swollen ive also recently felt like my right ear was fuller and sometimes painful namely at night before bedtime it still feels like my neck is tight when i drink liquids but only if i hold my neck out and at a certain angle the lymph node doesnt seem to have grown since i noticed it was enlarged either its possible according to my dentist that i might still have residual infection due to how bad my molar was
""
ive googled worst idea i know my symptoms and its continuing to tell me its cancerous because its not painful when i touch it but i dont have night sweats or fatigue or unexplained weight loss the right lymph node is about two fingertips in size and is only tender if i touch it a certain way feels harder than the left one and is on the side of the infection i hadhave i do have heavy periods as well and apparently that can be a symptom of lymphoma as well id really appreciate any insight im terrified thank you

i have had bad pain in both legs for a month now but it has gotten worse in my right calf in the last couple of weeks ive also been very short of breath
i went to the er because i couldnt breathe well and they told me i had an elevated d dimer so they scanned my chest only they said i was too young to have any clots
since then my pain has gotten worse and unless im seeing things i believe my leg is swollen compared to the other recently
i have bruises that come and go on both legs and i think varicose veins have started appearing on my legs these purple like spidery veins or theyre just blue raised veins and bruised in parts when the pain is bad i notice my veins become very visible in the area and lumpy raised
i have pain both at rest and when walking and have avoided working out the last month because of it i have a fit bit and ive also noticed my heart rate at rest has dropped from 60 to about 52

lets say this person collapsed and a nearby bystander immediately checks and notices the person is not breathing this bystander starts cpr and gets the person conscious and breathing again within 30 seconds the person is then transported to a hospital via ambulance

i have this thing that i thought just popped up when i was stressed but it just happened like a half hour ago when i was literally just laying down watching videos occasionally and its rare tbh my right hand will go completely numb not tingly completely numb all senses dulled to the point it genuinely feels like someone elses hand during this my right eye will be completely unable to focus on anything at all like i can see it kind of but it feels like a blank spot in the center of my vision and idk what it is
""
as it continues eventually i regain my vision but by then my lip goes numb for a little usually by then my arm is almost back to normal and my visions cleared up but not my lips are numb sometimes even my teeth i can still speak during these episodes i just cant focus on anything and my arm is still fully functional i can pick things up and use it i just cant feel it

two and half months ago i injured my shoulder while training for gymnastics i wanted to try this exercise timer at 028 httpsyoutube9o_zjajpqst28httpsyoutube9o_zjajpqst28 but after a few reps crack shit happens in my shoulder without any prior pain it felt like my arm was disconnected from my upper body
""
heres a picture you can see the peak on my right shoulder  httpsimgurcommvugbq5httpsimgurcommvugbq5
""
i went to hospital right after the injury i did some x rays they told me that i have grade ii ac separation and gave me a sling  i had an appointment with a surgeon the week after
""
the pain got way better after this week i couldnt move my arm a lot but i was able to remove the sling and not have any pain without it for everyday life
""
the surgeon told me that i have to keep the sling 3 more weeks and then go to a physical therapist but my right wrist got worse in the meantime and got very painful i couldnt even hold a water bottle in my hand so i didnt put the sling during these 3 weeks as i had only my left hand to do stuff
""
meanwhile the coronavirus quarantine started and all physical therapists in my area decided to close and are still closed today i was supposed to have 15 sessions but didnt do any 
""
ive been trying some rehab exercices that i found on the internet i got back all my range of motion but my shoulder is still painful to get back to sports it cant bear much weight

does it get better with time  im afraid to be unable to train again

hey all first time posting here and a tad worried mostly because im asking about an issue ive suffered for about a week now thats a bit embarrasing to say
""
recently i have started to get painful erections and painful climax whenever i have fun with myself i was sure it was down to me doing it too much but i noticed a bump on the left of my male part that hurts to touch it doesnt change the appearance of my male part but it is noticible if you feel around the area
""
i tried searching up what it could be and everywhere i look it seems to be peyronies disease but im unsure if it is i dont know what to do but im embarressed to ask for help from family

any help would be appreciated cause i dont know what to do
18 female 55 and about 135 pounds i had hip surgery 3 years ago for an impingement of my hip and damage to the labrum of my hip my surgeon wrote in my notes that the labrum in my hips is smaller than it should be which my new orthopedic said is more common for woman than men im seeing an orthopedic again because ive been having severe hip pain and they are doing an mri and a ct because he thinks either my labrum never healed from the surgery the impingement was not fully fixed or both he also said my hip is borderline dysplastic so that maybe could also effect things
""
ive been having the same type of pain in my left hip  just to a slightly lesser extent than my right the one i had surgery on its less frequent but it still hurts quite a lot how likely is it that its the same issue as well im scared to bring it up and have to do a lot of imaging again because i already have a lot of imaging bills and im already potentially looking at needing surgery again on my right hip if the issues are still there i also was recently diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and am being checked for issues with my si joints if that could change the answer at all
""
tldr i have had damage to my labrum and had an impingement in my right hip im having the same pains as ive had in my right in my left how likely is it that the pain is from an impingement as well i have seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and my ortho thinks i have issues with my si joints

hey everyone
""
for the last 2 days now i have had this weird numbing feeling in my right leg its located just at the bottom below the calf muscle and at the top of my foot at first i thought it was because i had been sitting on my leg in an awkward position it feels like a kind of pins and needles sensation when i touch it but if i dont touch it then i wouldnt know it was even numb
""
i can still walk around theres no discoloration around the area theres no blood in stools etc and im just confused as to how its happened ive always had big calfs from playing football soccer but i havent been able to properly exercise since the whole covid19 outbreak and its the same for my local gp i cant get hold of them at all due to the virus i still go a walk every day so im not couped up in doors all day every day
""
not sure if im maybe imagining it but the leg feels a little tight but again that could be me worrying about a blood clot at the moment its not bigger than my other leg and i havent lost feelingsensation etc
""
does anyone have any idea what this may be

i have been having small breathing difficulties for the past few weeks i usually am fine during the day even with hard physical work however at night it feels like someone is sitting on my chest sometimes i struggle to get a full breath sometimes it feels like i cant at all each normal breath feels like its maybe half of normal
""
today when having a normal conversation rather relaxed no yelling or talking fast etc i kept running out of breath mid sentence i had to stop to take deep breaths multiple times because it felt like i was holding my breath for a long time even though i had just breathed in around 5 to 10 seconds earlier
""
after a deep breath i can comfortably hold my breath for 30 seconds when lying down before these problems came up i used to be able to do this for at least a minute and a half to two minutes
""
i have somewhat recently moved to a higher elevation than im used to sea level to around 8000 feet these symptoms only started a couple weeks after arriving at my current residence

tldr seen for sprain ankle a month ago xray taken but no breaks felt a pop sensation when i moved it a certain way a few weeks ago pain been elevated since then to about a 6 or 7 most days was maybe 3 to 5 before do i figuratively walk it off and be patient or go see an orhto can still bear weight and walk but hurts 247
""
""
""
so a month or so ago i got my ankle xrayed and it was fine and i was told its just a sprain so you know ice wrap motrin elevate etc
""
ive been wrapping it mostly and icing it some but been off work since 315 and live in a small apartment so i dont walk around much more anyways so i didnt ice and elevate as much as i shouldve im sure since i was barely walking on it
""
but a few weeks ago i was laying in bed and turned my ankle on its side while adjusting and felt a pop kinda and the pain instantly got worse it hurt the whole rest of that day and the pain has stayed elevated pretty much sense then
""
most days its at an 6 with pain with it occasionally going higher momentarily depending on what im point
""
can bear weight but it hurts same with walking
""
my question is is this just par for the course or should i be worried and if i do go in should i go to an urgent care where all they can do is xray or go to an orthopedic doctor
""
i had a very similar thing happen years ago like when i was 1415 maybe where a sprain got worse then i found out i had a hairline fracture and had a walking cast for two weeks so i always worry when my ankles hurt its gonna be something like that again i continued practicing on my hurt ankle then for about 23 weeks before going in because i thought it was just a sprain and didnt wanna miss rehearsals
hey i am a 17 year old male with severe muscle spasms they happen in the shoulders elbows eyes neck jaw thighs and knees it takes extreme focus to stop them from happening but they can still happen at any given time i have been to multiple doctors and since i am underage my mother is with me my mother doesnt understand the severity of the issue and i cannot really talk to her about these sort of things so it always gets downplayed by other issues at our wellness visits i currently take 10mg of melatonin to help me sleep due to my insomnia and sleep apnea for the sleep apnea i went ahead and did a sleep study and i have episodes from anywhere from 2  7 times an hour for up to 3 minutes the melatonin has really helped my sleep but these spasms are making it very difficult to just live every day i cant go minutes and some times seconds without having at least one as i am typing this i have had several episodes of extreme spasms any help is appreciated i will give additional details if yall wish

i currently am only taking the occasional couple of tylenol every other day
my bed has a chair right next to it and i sometimes put my head on the chair while i sleep because its comfy monday morning in my sleep i accidentally slam my nose against the chairs armrest and woke up my nose of course hurt and i had gotten a nose bleed it was pretty heavy but only bled for like 1015 minutes i can only assume i left a tissue balled up in my nostril for longer since i forgot about it probably before drying up i clean up and go about my daily routine the rest of the day i had one or two more small nosebleeds out of nowhere and inexperienced a lot of dull pain in my nose and brow and some dull headaches i did not ice the nose at all cause i didnt think it was that much of an issue but now it and the skin around it is looking a tiny bit swollen should i have iced it and will it have an impact on how my nose develops
""
extra info in january i got into a fight with a kid and got hit like 56 times in the face specifically the nose and it the skin around it swollen for a couple weeks and i stopped wearing my glasses in case that interfered with the nose healingforming however that time i iced it immediately after the fight
i dont know where else to go during covid so i am going to try my luck posting here it all started 3 years ago after i had 2 major ear infections in both of my ears i am a huge music fan so not being able to fully enjoy music for an extended period of time was hard for me
""
during recovery i began to find my vision was changing it was becoming harder to focus on certain objects and i developed visual snow a constant static that covers my field of vision major points of contrast such as edges of logos or text on signs shimmer in my vision making it difficult to read
""
even after my ears had fully recovered my sense of hearing was never really the same they feel full and it feels like i am unable to hear silence anymore directional sound is almost gone its hard for me to tell where sounds are coming from and from how far
""
the eye doctor says i have perfect vision he tells me to use screens less though i already know thats not the problem the visual snow still persists
""
the ent says i have perfect hearing and no blockage or complications in either ear
""
i used to be a very creative happy funny person but after this has happened to me ive become very distant and numb i have brain fog poor short term memory its hard to stay present and in the moment or even enjoy or experience things i have poor control over my mental chalkboard or any thoughts at all for that matter
""
when i go to work i can often zone out for hours on end eyes glazed over im there but not really a zombie it feels like the moments before youre about to fall asleep youre there but drifting emotionless my ears dont work as i want my eyes dont work as i want i have little to no sense of smell im not present enough to enjoy taste or experience touch its like all absence of senses is being filled in
""
for example i cannot see pitch black lack of light because the graininess flashing in my eyes like when you stare at the sun or a bright light only covering my entire field of vision lack of vision is filled in with flashing static
""
i cant hear silence sometimes its tinnitus sometimes its bodily noises or breathing or ambient sound but it takes up all hearing capacity i can no longer hear the air between the sources of sound lack of hearing is being filled in with tinnitus or overloaded by the sounds being heard
""
i cannot think or live in the present moment because it feels like my brain is at full capacity or that i am being pushed out lack of thought is being filled in with brain fog and subconscious thought

ive tried abstaining from masturbation and pornography no luck

please help me with this i know this is a lot it could perhaps be multiple things but if you can help me out at all i would be so very grateful ive been dealing with this for too long i want to get on with my life but with these symptoms it feels like my life goes on without me

my wrists knuckles neck ankles all have the feeling one has when one needs to crack something but i have that feeling in those places 100 of the time
""
it also decreases my mobility in those parts for example rotating my hand to the left increases the uncomfortable sensation and it also feels like i cannot rotate it all the way as if something hardthe part that cracks prevents me from doing so
""
i think i have the same thing on my lower back and experience pain while sitting down
""
the place where i feel the discomfort is the place that cracks
""
i feel as if this feeling on my wrist for example could have been caused by typing really fast and hard on the computer even when sore for many years but im not sure

any guesses
hi there
""
since the lockdown started ive experienced 3 or 4 times now but havent had it for a week or two now these scary electric jolt sensations in my chest when lying down
""
the first one was the worst and was when i was lying in bed reaching over for something and my whole upper body was a bit contorted the other times were when i was lying on the couch and the jolts werent as apparent but still there
""
im a healthy 27 year old woman and have never had this issue before and am anxious about my health so am highly aware of any slight changes in my bodyhealth
""
after googling i know this was a bad idea im freaking out that i have ms or heart issues the jolts lasted only a second the length of a short boom sound and the pain disappeared immediately
""
any advice would be much appreciated
""
thank you so much

so im total idiot i had qtips in my ears and i lifted my arm up causing one of them to jam in my ear pretty far it was immediately painful and i started bleeding i held my nose and blew and could feel air escaping so i realized what i had done problem is i cant see a doctor for some time as im out of the country and on lockdown i have a flight home in a couple days from philippines to usa not sure what to do other than lay on my side and let it drain god im so fucking stupid this happened an hour ago and its still fairly painful especially when moving my head or swallowing im try to avoid doing both still bleeding a bit i can hear but it is pretty muffled and feels full or like something is stuck inside my ear like cotton im worried about the flight and the pressure that it will cause im going to see what i can do to go to a doctor while im hear but it will be really difficult to do since there is no transportation soonest i can see a doctor for sure is when i get home may 3rd
15m hemorrhoids symptoms have gone away recently since i started taking metamucil but recently i have seen some small spots of red on the stool nothing on tp just in the stool someone on this sub already had the same thing and the physician replied saying not to worry about it but then he said the colours to worry about are clay and black looking back on my camera roll because ive been recording my bowel movements i see a stool that is normal but with a large chunk of paleness in it other stools have been dark brown but not black and others have been really small and thin mixed in with other stools that were larger should i worry about any of these
so i am 16 years old and it is 5 am in the morning where i am i had random chest pains and my anxiety went off i looked it up and it said you also get cold sweats and i was having that but it could be from anxiety

im a 42 year old caucasian male muscular 61 tall and i weigh 187lbs and ive been trying to get rid of my lower backache for over a year now its only getting worse currently its driving me crazy i dont do drugs other then the ones prescribed to me for my adhd 36mg concerta daily i started those somewhat less then a year ago
""
the pain is most severe in the mornings it originates from somewhere between my left hip and lower back somewhere in that connection the pain radiates into my left leg and makes my toes tingle its like an electrical pain the whole area surrounding my hips feels very stiff as if i have exercised a lot as the day advances it gets better but doesnt go away completely i walk a lot and that seems to alleviate it somewhat but only very temporarily and the end of the afternoon im exhausted because of it and all i want to do is lie down
""
after 20 sessions my physical therapist didnt know what to do with me anymore and he suggested to seek the help of a specialist so i went to my gp who then transferred me to a neurologist the neurologist examined me but didnt find any evidence for neurological pain not enough to see any necessity for having a scan done anyway he also consulted with a rheumatologist for me but he didnt know either after that i saw an osteopath that seemed to help in the beginning or maybe it was wishful thinking after 10 sessions and lots of money because insurance didnt cover it im worse off then i started out
""
if i search online then a trapped sciatica nerve seems have the best matching description to my symptoms but i have no idea what can be done about it i did some exercises that shown online but those were excruciatingly painful and made things worse i also read that a trapped sciatica nerve resolves by itself after 6 weeks so that cant be it right

please please please help me and point me in the right directed

just noticed now and started wondering about it hopefully its okay to ask this approximately halfway down my back in line with two ribs up from bottom on the other side
exactly what title says i had a warm bath and after i got out i had a wave of nausea that lasted for about a minute what could have caused it
removed
with covid having everything shut down and having no doctor due to a poor insurance i dont know what to do heres the story
""
i cleaned between my legs and scrotum too rough and rubbed it raw it was red and wet and had a smell like fish somewhat
""
i went to the er got antibiotics took them all and put triple antibiotic cream on the area too
""
the smell went away for a little while but where i put the triple antibiotic started to itch and my skin wrinkled and peeled a little bit the fish strong smell is back and its embarrassing
""
the initial wound is just about completely healed
""
did the skin on my leg peel because the area couldnt breathe and stayed wet with triple antibiotic and why does it smell just as strong as when i first injured it what should i do what does this mean
hey all
""
for the past 4 days ive had a really sweet sickly taste in my mouth consistently  its quite strong and tastes as if ive just eaten very slightly off apples or pears its quite unpleasant and i also felt pretty nauseous on sunday but dont know if this is a related symptom
""
everything online says its diabetes so i bought a blood glucose test cant visit the gp in the current climate ive tested a few times at different times of the day and my blood glucose is within the normal range each time
""
any idea what else this sweet taste could be a symptom of
""
its worth mentioning that i have been avoiding all sugary foods since the taste started and before that i didnt overindulge im a regular and healthy weight 140 pounds and 5 foot 8 and exercise a couple times a week although admittedly this has slipped somewhat since lockdown i dont drink often dont smoke and havent taken drugs in a month or so i dont have any preexisting conditions im aware of that could affect it

thanks in advance
last night i was playing some games with some friends had one noise cancelling headphone over my right ear to hear them speak and my left ear was open to listen to the game sound from my tv
""
after our session i led down and watched some films i began to feel ill and sicky aswell as my hearing in my left ear feeling a little muffled and began to develop an ear ache i woke up a few times in the night due to the ear ache in my left ear when i woke up the ache was gone but my hearing still felt muffled to a very very small extent but just enough to notice it when im playing music or sound i dont notice it too much but with little things like chewing or humming i can tell
""
also when im in silence i can hear the quietest quietest white noise type static sound in my left ear
""
ive tried a few techniques such as blowing thru my nostrils when they are covered so my ear pops and it does pop but after a few swallows it returns to being slightly muffled
""
this was the situation for a couple days just muffled hearing with no pain up until this morning
""
lately ive been falling asleep late and waking up in the afternoon but today i just woke up much earlier with excruciating pulsating pain in my left ear aswell as even more muffled hearing whenever i move my jaw or swallow there seems to be a crackling in my ear i very softly put a cotton bud in my ear and worked out that inside is very sensitive about a centimetre in to my ear
""
really worried about this taken some pain relief pills but they havent done anything yet and have used a cold compress to no avail
about two weeks ago i 35m started noticing an itch when i urinated i went in a couple days later for a urinalysis assuming it was a uti but it came back clean no bacteria no blood etc gp i was at prescribed me a round of antibiotics just in case because he didnt know what else it could be but i finished those a week ago and not much has changed

its progressed from an itch into mild pain most of the time when i urinate but not always and some itching that i mostly notice at night when im in bed with corona i dont want to go back to the doctors office if its not anything he can help with and the gp didnt seem to have any clue what it could be anyone have any suggestions is this something i should just ignore and hope it goes away in a few weeks or is there something else i should have looked at

primary complaint a few days ago i was sat too long in a pose that was putting pressure on my left hip bone when i got up it still hurt but i thought nothing of it and carried on my day this will now be the 4th day of it still hurting which makes me worried the damage could be more severe than just having sat funny for one day as a lot of people these days im sat down a lot although i do exercise everyday either a 30 minute  1 hour walk or 30 minute  1 hour of runningcycling
""
i often tend to sit with my left leg crossed under me or in front as this is just what i find comfy as most other poses feel uncomfortable after a while not sure if this will have over time aggravated it but i thought id add it
""
ive never had this pain before its right around the hip joint itself if i feel right at the top of my groin around the bone it feels sore like a bruise
""
i recently tried some stretches to try get rid of the pain one of which was lying on my back and drawing one leg to my chest and then turning the ankle this felt good but i think it might have aggravated the area before this pain happened i had been running 23 times a week although i have since stopped because i was really struggling with wheezing while running another issues entirely i instead cycled yesterday for the first time in years and i think the rigid seat has also aggravated my pain so im really unsure what if any exercise i should be doing asides from walking as its quite impact free

existing medial issues my hips have clicked or caught for as long as i can remember its only now im wondering if the left hip was more prone to this it doesnt hurt when it pops its more like an uncomfortable feeling because it doesnt feel right like my hip isnt properly in place when i stand up every now and again i also sometimes suffer with lower back pain which i think is down to my posture and having a weak coretight hip flexors this is something i work on each day with stretches im unsure if trying to sit properly has shifted my weight to my hips which arent used to the pressure and are as such hurting

since the beginning of the covid19 isolation that my province went into march 19now i have unfortunately been pretty sedentary due to exhaustion from my recent school semester and depression doctor diagnosed but not on meds most of the days i have spent in a sitting or lyingdown position maybe only standing for 15 hrs per day
""
recently since about a week ago midlate april i developed throbbinglike pains in my legs that come and go and seem to migrate around the pains feel most similar to a tender bruise except i dont need to touch my legs to feel that same sensation it almost feels like if someone was standing around and poking at bruises all over my legs
""
the pains will be at times in my lower calf area then ankles then sides of my knees then iliotibial band of my upper thighs all over the place
""
i have also had some accompanying muscle twitching
""
i havent seen any swollen veins or lumps that might suggest any large blood clots but is it possible that i have an kind of thrombosis or is this the feeling of my muscles wasting away
""
by the way i do plan to increase my physical activity soon ive just had a bad month here trying to recover from a hectic academic year
about a year and 4 months ago in december my tonsils became mediocrly enlarged i had not recently been sick come that june i got very sick it started as a head cold then moved to my stomach the sickness in whole lasted about 25 weeks at the end of it i had a head cold again and i inexplicably got pink eye during this sickness my tonsils began to ache and my throat was really sore my tonsils became further enlarged and were almost touching the uvula a short time after the aches went away but my tonsils have remained that size since my family practitioner said there was no problem as did my ent but did not offer any explainationi am an 18 year old female and have no previous history of tonsil problems my grandma however has had tonsil issues and had them removed and they grew back also i have not had any tonsil stones
""
is there an explaination to why my tonsils may have become enlarged in the first place or have continued to be any explaination to my weird sickness in general

early this morning i was jarred awake by something i think it was my body feeling off and i impulsively stood up and took a few steps before collapsing because my body felt incredibly heavy and i felt dizzy my arms caught me and i sat for a few minutes feeling like i might lose consciousness my heart was beating really fast but i never actually lost consciousness i was able to climb back into bed while still feeling dizzy and a bit nauseous but quickly felt normal again
""
i do have lower blood pressure but still at normal levels i have hereditary high cholesterol and i think i am a bit paranoid because my grandpa died in his late 20s from presumed heart disease although he was in bootcamp for the military so under a lot of irregular circumstances i feel like my heart rate can be pretty slow sometimes for someone who doesnt work out like 54 bpm when resting but it doesnt feel irregular does this sound normal to almost lose consciousness like this

so ive had this around since in 8th grade where i could crack my knees shoulders loud and my fingers just by bending them now im in 11th grade 2 weeks ago i was at a friends house and i wanted to tie my shoes and they realized that i could crack my knees when i started to bend down
""
so i started showing off on that its like cracking your fingers so i started to dance like a russian where it requires you to bend them a lot and put a lot of pressure on them around 2 weeks later here i am crying about not being literally able to bend them without nearly crying it depends on how much i can bend them i cant sit on them or in other words put pressure on them
so if anyone could help it would make my day im honestly very worried and if i could get some help first and find out what the problem is then i will go straight to a doctor
""
again i cannot bend them a little nor having them straight without feeling hardcore pain thanku

every night i deal with theses an hour or two after i go to sleep ill sort of wake up but only very slightly im sort of still dreaming or something because ill think i see or hear things a lot of the time these things try to attack me or rob my house or something distressing i actually get up and try to confront or run away from these things ive very nearly called 911 for help because i legit think theres bad people in the house eventually after a few minutes i wake up a bit more and then realize that none of this was real unfortunately by the time ive come to im usually pretty worked up and stressed out and then it makes it near impossible to get back to sleep

ive spoken to a few different doctors about this but they literally have no idea what im talking about and look at me like im an idiot ive spoken to 2 psychiatrists and they didnt give me any advice either ive tried sleeping pills tried not eating before bed tried lots of exercise during the day to tire myself out but nothing works

i had a really bad cold mid september i thought it was the flu ive had it before but without the fever nausea and vomiting it was odd because it felt different i was also having panic attacks and i never do it took about maybe 253 weeks to recover from congestion and coughing but then came the pain i woke up one day with an electric shock from my back outwards to my arms to this day i still have pain at my cervical and upper thoracic area sometimes my ribs feel so bruised i get shortness of breath chest pain and shoulder pain i stopped talking my birth control pills on it for 4 years prior bc i was getting me periods twice a month now that im off of it my cycles are normal
""
i have seen my pcp he recommended me to physical therapy which helped short term but him and the pas at the office think im way too young to experience back pain which is why they recommended me to pt instead of getting an mri
""
around feb 2020 i started getting headaches daily 247 went back to pcp and they prescribed me a migraine medication dont remember name not sure if it helped honestly but my headaches have decreased to maybe 34 times a week i told the pa about my back and chest pains that i still have and my new symptom where my legs would just feel so tired sleep does not help she recommended i drink gatorade and water which is what i only drink and prescribed me a higher dose of tylenol
""
i called back 2 days later to ask for a referral to a rheumatologist and they asked why which hello they should know why they gave me a referral but i havent called to schedule an appointment yet
""
i looked back at my old blood tests in 2017 and my ana was negativeat that time i was having weird allergic reactions all over my body
""
so im really at a loss right now should i see a rheumatologist or find a new pcp i know with how it is currently i probably wont be able to be scheduled in for awhile i feel like maybe i do need an mri and at the same time i might have an autoimmune disease idk im trying not to overthink and give myself a panic attack yesterday i went to bed at 6pm bc i felt like i was going to die i felt so nauseous shortness of breath and my hands were tingly and my tongue felt like it was going numb

any advice would help
i dont really want to get this checked out with all thats going on but once every 23 days ill get some chest pain it feels like it pulses is very transient

since around november of 2018 ive been experiencing a temperature that fluctuates between 373 and 382 theres usually no other symptoms although every once and a while ill have chills and a bit of dizziness went to a general doctor in spring of 2019 because it was affecting my work im a kindergarten teacher and cannot be around the children with a fever and had some blood tests that revealed everything was fine except i had irondeficiency anemia although my doctor said that would affect my body temperature he gave me supplements for the deficiency but after my temperature read normal after my second blood test we just never talked about the fevers again
""
i came to assume that maybe i have a naturally high body temperature or maybe it was just stress and heightened anxiety having an effect on my body so i figured it would eventually right itself and stopped monitoring my temperatures my health anxiety has gotten worse in the last half a year or so so i started randomly checking my temperature again and i noticed that i was still recording a low grade fever in particularly one over 375 more than half the time due to covid ive been monitoring my temperature twice a day for work i have been working from home and effectively isolating and since the beginning of april my temperature has only been below 372 three times not three days i dont think its covid but im in japan and even if i desperately needed to be tested theyd probably reject me
""
recently ive noticed my temperature will spike between 377 and 38 during the day and drop to 3734 late at night ive developed mild acid reflux over the year but other than that and my anxiety i dont have any other health issues that ive been diagnosed with i have no fatigue disorientedness cough or trouble breathing i occasionally take an over the counter antacid at most three times a week for upset stomach i do experience slight pain in the chest and arm occasionally but i just assume its from either the reflux or the anemia
""
am i letting my health anxiety get the best of me and turning nothing into something

i am getting random cramps in my low abdomen that last for a minute or two the pain can range from a bit of pain to unable to move till it passes i have them for four years but the past few weeks they have been getting worse i have been told i have polycystic ovaries by my gp but my last checkup i was told they have gone my periods are months apart my last one was early april then the one before that was mid october my last one was very light it seemed more like i was spotting but it lasted twelve days
""
for the last two three months i have been getting random hard heartbeatsor skipping a heartbeat i dont really know how to describe it it is only ever just one but it will happen multiple times a day when it happens i can feel it down my left arm and sometimes in my neck
""
throughout the day i have been getting dizzy spells the room will feel like it is shaking from side to side it has been going on for over a month but it has been easing up i still have the lightheaded feeling most days
""
a new issue i have been dealing with lately is the shakes my hands are shaky and my body will sometimes feel like it is trembling it scares me when it happens when my whole body trembles to the point i cant move much i will get the odd hard heartbeat
""
the past few weeks i have been getting very poor sleep sometimes i can sleep for up to fifteen hours and other days i can go a whole day without sleep it flip flops whether i can sleep or not the most hours of sleep i have got was seventeen hours and the most i have gone without sleep is thirty hours and even then i struggled to get off to sleep
""
i am worried about these issues and i cant go see my gp due to the lockdown and as more time goes on the more i get worried some of the issues are getting better while others are getting worse
""
i have no idea what is going on with my body i would like some peace at mind even if its bad news i dont like not knowing
how long of no sleep becomes serious and would be classed as an emergency is there anything that i should do should i be worried
removed
please bear with me because im just trying to describle how im feeling because i have no clue what is going on with me as of recently i have been having these periodical moments where if i think about something it almost makes me jump or want to pass out sort of ive had panic attacks on and off these past 2 years but havent had one in a while also sometimes if i shift my eyes randomly i get that feeling of jumpiness if anyone can provide some insight as to what im feeling right now id greatly appreciate it ask me any question you want ill be happy to answer

im aware this is a problem many people would love to have i dont want to sound like im humblebragging nor do i want to trigger anyone with eating disorders but im just a bit confused by my weight and wonder if i should weigh more to be healthy
""
when i was 16 i weighed just under 140lbs over the course of the next 6 months i starved myself eating around 300400 calories a day to a point where on an extreme day i was 105lbs but generally floating around the 110115 mark despite my bmi still being healthy friends family and teachers were terrified for me i was weak and pale my hair was thinning i refused to eat and people assumed i weighed a lot less than i did i wasnt technically underweight but i somehow looked it i was severely malnourished but my body simply refused to drop into the underweight range no matter how hard i tried
""
my early and mid twenties replaced starving with binging and purging i basically stayed the same weight  maintaining a 114 average dropping to 110 or 112 if id had a busy week or eaten really healthily maybe rising to 116117 if id eaten more than usual
""
my late twenties that just stopped  it wasnt really a conscious decision one day it just faded out gradually as my life changed and i stopped throwing up about 2 years ago i started just eating whatever i wanted whenever i wanted it didnt eat particularly healthily and indulged in whatever i felt like and took the approach of im nearly 30 i might want kids one day i need my body to be at its natural comfortable weight even if that means gaining a stone i did light cardio at the gym a couple of times a week mostly for boosting energy levels  maybe 30 minutes of fast walking or light jogging on a treadmill or using a crosstrainer nothing massive
""
well im now 30 i havent exercised since this current global situation started im at home sitting on my backside all day eating three meals and several snacks a day some of which are really healthy many of which arent
""
im still about 114lbs and fit into jeans i bought as a 17 year old my body is the same weight as when i used to live off yogurts and air ive also gone up about 3 cup sizes in the chest where i was flatchested before but i weigh the same
""
my family all struggle to keep their weight down my mum has to deprive herself a lot in order to stay a uk size 1214 and was fat most of her life no one in my family has a fast metabolism
""
but i experience constant fatigue and brain fog i can sleep for half a day at a time i have no energy and have been like this for as long as i can remember several years at least
""
im worried theres something wrong with me thats keeping my weight at what for my body is a low point compared to the weight i was preed despite me eating whatever i damn well please my 30 year old female friends have reached the point where they have to strictly diet while they mourn the body of their twenties my scale reads the same as when i was a 17 year old being told i looked like i needed to be hospitalised yet now i somehow look healthy and dont put any effort into being this size
""
should recovery from longterm eating disorders at my age not result in some sort of gain i eat really indulgently and never deprive myself of anything and im not currently exercising at all im always fatigued which makes me think am i still not eating enough im 30 and feel like there must be something wrong with me im worried about my long term health and my fertility and i want to make sure my body is where it naturally wants to be i dont understand why that would be 25lbs lighter at 30 than it was when i was a 16 year old eating exactly as i am now
""
tldr i weigh around the same as a denymyselfnothing 30 year old woman as i did as an anorexic teenager i dont understand how or why and im worried my body isnt where it naturally should be for long term health is it just that this is where i naturally balanced out or might there be some sort of underlying condition going on

i already suffer from anxiety so this is only making things seem worse for me i have a mild cough no runny nose no sore throat feeling fatigued and minor body aches i am not sure if i have a fever yet but i will be getting that checked once the thermostat is delivered to my house if i have no fever does that indicate that its not coronavirus
""
i also dont know if my symptoms are stemming from my really bad anxiety or if i truly have a flu or coronavirus i am hesitant to take a benzodiazepine due to the increased risk of pneumonia they could cause however i really need to set my mind at ease

what should i do
it only came out when i curiously squeezed my breast a little to sorta see if something was up and sure enough a little blood came out i felt my heart drop right after i saw it and basically bolted to the bathroom to get a better look and noticed that there was also a little bit of brown discharge coming from the bottom of my nipple and blood from the top im going to the doctor within a few days i just wanna know if this is something i should be extremely concerned about or if this is just a small infection in my ducts or something

135lbs  58  causcasian  shoulder pain for 7 months
""
back in october 2019 i was working out doing lateral raises or arm flies with 710lb weights cant remember i was doing them straight armed putting all the stress on my shoulder instead of the right way which is with a little bend in the elbow to take the strain off the shoulder i felt a little twinge in my inner r shoulder that i thought was just a strain or pulled muscle but later that week i could hardly lift my arm above my head without even a little pain
""
now it hurts when i raise my arm above my head or to reach above my head to grab or push something sometimes a sharp shooting pain will go down to my elbow it hurts to do pushups or presses and its on the inside i cant massage it or anything its definitely interior
""
it has not been relieved going on 7 months now i did read up about rotator cuff injuriestears but wasnt sure if it was one i dont want shoulder problems for the rest of my life
""
is this serious enough to be seen how long do shoulder injuries like this take to heal on their own any exercises to help the healing process any advice
""
no medical conditions dont take medications dont use any drugs or alcohol
most of the days i wake up with very weakened feeling in heart area and some amount of pain some days its more severe then others almost every night seconds before i fall asleep my body randomly shakes my hand or leg or an arm and at the same time my heart starts producing pain and im having hard time breathing after waking up my heart aches and my chest feels heavy so i need some time to feel normal but some days it dont go away i had my heart checked by cardiogram in january and doc said u just need to breathe deeper
""
i have chronic tonsilitis angina ive had gone tonsilitis removal surgery back in october and after that my health condition has not been been so good
""
im also on benzo withdrawal and i have prolonged stress and high anxiety some nights heart pain is so severe that i wake up seeking for air
""
i kknow it must be mostly stress induced but i fear that it could be some cardiovascular problem or damaged heart mussle since ive read complications of angina and infection in general often damages the heart system
""
my incurancecovered hospital is a mess and everytime i step in i feel like i need to prove that im not ok now even my insurance is expired and dont have any funds avaliable so could i be worried more is there something particular i should consider doing could it be emergency

19f my appetite has been rapidly decreasing over the last 3 months went from eating 3 healthy meals a day to 12 a meal every 2 days
""
i do not feel hunger anymore the only reason why i do eat is because ill feel faint or have a headache and even then i always feel full usually i can only eat very very small amounts before feeling uncomfortably full were talking maybe half an apple 23 pieces of cheese or a small cup of soup i weighed 140 pounds in february now weigh 95 pounds as of april 29th and still dropping every day im 56 tall

bloodwork came back okayish iron deficiencyanemia but not much else no celiac no inflammation associated with crohns lupus not ruled out yet but unlikely doctor checked for masses breasts and stomach scan came back okay too
""
she literally cannot explain why im feeling the way i am it is not anxiety or depression i feel absolutely fine and the only anxiety im feeling is towards the fact that i look like a skeleton right now
""
forcing myself to eat does not do anything i usually just end up throwing my food back up if i eat too much im wondering if i should ask about the possibility of a feeding tube at this point since i am starting to have a bunch of weight related issues headaches cold feet and hands always cold pain in my legs and ribcage feeling faint fainted 4 times while getting up over the past month
""
is this something that could be worth mentioning on my end and is this something that could potentially help me once again i know that depression or anxiety can cause appetite loss but i know for a fact its not that so we really have no idea whats causing all of this
""
i just want to be able to go for walks again without feeling like im gonna pass out every 5 seconds

""
before i explain what happened and ask my questions i want to mention that im a longtime sufferer of generalized anxiety disorder and ocd i have severe health anxiety and contamination anxiety
""
im currently very worried about something for 4 years i lived in an old apartment complex that may have had lead paint in it i dont remember anybody mentioning lead paint but it was built in the 50s
""
in the shower i set my shampoo bottles and soaps on the windowsill which was covered in cracked white paint i didnt use a soap dish for my bar of soap and remember noticing that some of the white paint was rubbing off onto the bottom of the soap
""
now i know this sounds crazy but because of my contamination anxiety there were times i filled up my sink with soapy water i may have used bars of soap with the white paint on the bottom to get the water soapy and swished that water in my mouth i dont remember how many times i did that possibly a lot i understand that sounds laughable and i certainly dont do that anymore but i hadcontinue to have all kinds of obsessions and compulsions that were only satisfied by cleaning with soap and water
""
while living in that apartment i remember going through a period where i experienced brain fog and didnt feel as sharp or intelligent
""
does anybody think i could have suffered from lead poisoning due to using the a bar of soap with paint on the bottom on my body in the shower and swishing soapy water that was made with the same bar around in my mouth
""
does lead paint poisoning affect the intelligence of adults
""
considering its been 2 years since i lived in that apartment i assume its too late to get a blood test for lead is a bone lead test something i could look into

on the evening of 427 around 8pm i noted him scratching the back bottom of his hairline a lot and figured he was sweaty and dirty from the day and put him in the bath before bed noticed 3 spread out bumps on his back that looked like bug bites they specifically looked to me like small ant bites earlier in the day he had played in the back yard for a little bit but did not complain about getting bit by anything put cortisone cream on them and he went to bed he woke up around 1 am on 428 fervently itching the bumps spread all over his back and his scalp was very itchy no noticeable bumps on his scalp but it felt like there were raised bits moved him to a different bed put on my antiitch cream and given a childrens benadryl
""
morning of 428 he was very itchy again and now had a ring of redness around his front hairline and behind ears he had two larger bumps that looked more like welts on his hip bones and on each butt cheek he was given cortisone cream and benadryl throughout the day developed a weltbumpswollenness in one eyebrow throughout the day his smaller bumps on his back started to go down but new bumps appeared on the back of his leg and on his cheek
""
morning on 429 he was given a colloidal oatmeal bath again bumps on his back are slightly visible but way down from what they were welts on his hip bones have completely disappeared new bumps on the front of his stomach and arm have appeared but much more sparse than the initial round of bumps on his back

have checked for lice checked for bugs in his sandbox checks mattress for bedbugs checked dog for fleas and found nothing

for the last couple days ive been urinating more than usual with it flaring up here and there nothing too crazy so i decided to wait it off thinking maybe it was just my diet or something small
""
well today ive had slight abdominal discomfort not pain but it just felt uncomfortable it later went away and i tried to go to sleep and around 1 am i started peeing every 45 min approx here i am 5 am still peeing at that rate i cant sleep etc i plan on trying to get my medical insurance figured out today if not im just going to the doctor tomorrow costs or not
""
any advice or possible thoughts as to what it can be i havent been drinking any caffeine or energy drinks and my diet has remained consistent the whole time i thought bananas had an effect on me and for a while they just started it but now after letting go of consuming them i had this happen and im confused scared etc

the day before yesterday i hurt my right shoulder when i suddenly reached after my falling hat it was like a small kinda electric shock and it didnt hurt for too long
""
yesterday everything was fine until i hung the laundry in the evening after which my shoulder started to hurt pretty badly as in about half an hour later a throbbing pain started at the frontside of my shoulder near the joint somewhat like a knife stabbing it this radiates down to my forearm affecting my elbow too first i couldnt really raise my arm all the way up or move it all around and sudden movements caused a sharp pain running through my arm starting from my shoulder i tried to gently massage it and found that its tender nearby the joint i thought its just an odd pain and will go away by itself and eventually went to sleep i was sleeping on my other side not to put pressure on my aching shoulder
""
i woke up to this stabbing sensation in the middle of the night after which i managed to fall asleep again on my back my arm positioned next to me at this point i had to help with my other arm because it was very painful to try to move it when i woke up my hand was numb now that went away because i was able to move my arm somewhat my forearm mostly moving my upper arm needs a little help and i found keeping it close to my body like in a sling is relatively okay i also noticed my neck is a bit stiff my shoulder blade hurts on the right side when i move my head that direction turning is okay tho i managed to go to the hospital to seek help
""
now i am an expat and i dont really speak the local language definitely not good enough to deal with a medical situation my hubby accompanied me hes a native speaker and knows about the whole deal at the front desk they sent us to the orthopedics department hubby explained the situation doc asked me to move my arm up i couldnt so he helped a bit i still couldnt raise it even to shoulder height without feeling extreme pain then he tried to bend it behind my back but again extreme pain after a relatively short movement he ordered an xray they took one from the front and after i got the results i went back
""
there was a different doc this time around guess morning shift and afternoon shift maybe who just told me its because i broke it when i was a kid well ive never broke any bones before no real diagnosis or treatment was offered besides try to take a rest i asked for some painkillers because the pain was gradually getting worse and he prescribed bulleyaconitine a tablets to take it as needed three per day tops and i got dismissed
""
first thing was to take one of those pills its not doing anything or at least i cant really notice it if anything the pain got worse now the smallest movement causes that sharp pain running through my arm i cant find a comfortable position where the constant stabbing pain in my shoulder stops my fingers are getting numb if i stop pumping my fist no matter how i keep my arm i tried to put some ice on my shoulder but its not doing anything either
""
will this thing go away by itself if i try my best not to move or should i go back to the hospital and start to flip tables
so saturday morning i woke up with pain in my mouth my papillae i think i thought they were my taste buds but google tells me theyre not were swollen and angry and my whole tongue felt like how after you eat too many saltvinegar chips i am not a mouth breather and the night before my so and i had a good bit of wine and got pretty tipsy also very abnormal of us we hardly ever drink so i just figured maybe i fell asleep with my mouth open all night and it dried out but as the days progressed each day it got worse
day 2 i started developing two ulcerscanker sores on my top gums essentially one on either side my gums got these tiny red freckles all over them and it was beginning to get very painful all over the gums around my teeth started getting swollen and when i brushed my teeth it was very uncomfortable
day 3 was pretty much the same but a little more intense when i brushed my teeth when i spit there would be drops of blood both bright red and like a more tanish tint presumably driedold blood
day 4 yesterday was absolutely the worst it hurt to talk eating even soft things like jello is nearly impossible without wanting to cry i was in so much pain that i couldnt even brush my teeth in the morning i remembered that we got a different toothpaste a short while ago few weeks thought maybe i was allergic prior to this whole tongue thing i did have another canker sore that had developed maybe a week prior and had stuck around until this so my thought was that maybe my body is slowly telling me it cant handle the toothpaste idk but i forced myself to brush my teeth and went on my not so merry way ive been sucking on cough drops to numb the pain
day 5 this morning i was able to brush my teeth although still uncomfortable but my gums feel better my tongue on the other hand is still screaming in pain a few specific papillae are incredibly swollen and red and the tip of my tongue stings to touch when i brushed this morning the amount of blood reminded me of when i got my teeth pulled but when i touch my mouth with a napkin it doesnt seem like theres any spots that are bleeding so i cant tell exactly where its coming from
""
im terrified to go to the doctor right now with this coronavirus and normally i would just try to wait it out but this is starting to freak me out i cant even drink water without wincing in pain does anyone have personal experience or knows anything about whats going on can i treat it without medicine or do i have to go somewhere should i be as scared as i am

2 months ago my wife and i went on a trip stayed in a hotel for 2 days and did some sports zip lining climbing when we came back in the first week we had a cold sore throat runny nose
""
after that first week i started experiencing abdominal cramps usually in the afternoon after lunch for the first two days i literally pooped in water after that i went to a doctor who prescribed a medicine for parasites and did an ultrasound exam the only thing found were two small polyps in my gallbladder
""
after i took the medicine i started to feel much better after two weeks the symptoms returned now my doctor said that there might be some viruses and he did not have any more tests heres the thing its time for the coronavirus and i live in brazil i dont want to take any chances and go back to my doctor

its not a strong pain but more like a general discomfort sometimes on the right side sometimes on the middle sometimes in the left or back

ever since 3 years ago i have this unexplainable illness happening on recurrent basis involving nausea and general unwellness and tiredness it is very difficult to explain properly there is never any sharp pain more like lack of energy and mild dull sensation in my stomach that is quite uncomfortable and foggy brain i can probably explain it as feeling that you are about to get sick but never actually goes 100 sick or the day after you ran your first marathon and all you want to do is to lie down and let your body recover this problem has come and gone on recurrent basis without any patterns whatsoever it has happened when i am on holiday on weekend on weekdays times of high stress times of low stress and so on and so forth i also slept 78 hours at times and still have this and there are days i sleep less and not having this basically no patterns i can discern
""
it is almost like a switch one day i would just wake up and the feeling is totally gone and i feel 100 again for few weeks until it comes again at first it was very nauseous and i focus on that and went to gastroenterologists they run some tests on me ct scan colonoscopy and endoscopy and found nothing is wrong now i have changed the way i ate and nausea has lessened but the recurring feeling of illness remains
""
also done blood tests once a year every year with nothing particularly wrong
""
i have maintained health diary and i found out that about 20 of my days in the last 3 years i feel like this whenever i went to gp they just attributed it to stress and to just rest more but i think i know my body best and it is definitely not stress or the lack of rest i am really not sure how else to progress getting really desperate and frustrated to be honest any ideas on what i should test for and what kind of specialists i should go to going forward
female 40 hypopiturism hydrocortisone growth hormone nifepene uk

so my immunologist wants me taking vitamin d3 at 40000 units ive done this a few times as mine is super low due to my hypopiturism
""
however my gp will always refuse to prescribe it meaning my immunologist has to which he doesnt have a problem with at all
""
can you overdose on it how much would you have to take to overdose on it i thought you just peed it out how long would it take would you die or just get other symptoms if so
""
just wondering why my gp doesnt like to do it always says its too high a dose

thank you all

our two year old daughter has had in hindsight very excessive thirst and urination for quite a while now she finishes her bottles immediately and will ask for more and more and more she urinates frequently and in large amounts she soaks night diapers quickly i also notice that she grabs at her private areas however this part i figured that was normal for two year olds my fatherinlaws mother was type 1 diabetic do i need a referral for an appointment or can i just make one with a pediatric endo also are there any other questions you have for me to determine what this could be

this could be long but im going to make it short the past 6 months or so ive had two instances where i was running and post run my lateral mid part of my foot turns into shooting pain this happened running indoors on a treadmill on my right foot and i was out for weeks from this no vigorous activity and even at home i could barely get around it went away like it was no issue to even begin with and i was able to be active again and run
""
then come a week ago this happened again but on my opposite foot same exact pain and unfortunately im out again this time its less intense thankfully this time i was running outdoors on a trail not sure if that matters but to give you some perspective i was most likely working out in a shoe that couldve been too small for me i prefer shoes to be very snug and not the 12 size above normal like others recommend i also believe i am flat footed and possibly wide in the foot if that helps any
""
i recently looked up some foot issues and stumbled upon foot pain identifier website and because this occurs off and on its saying that chronically its lateral column overloadhttpsfooteducationcomlateralcolumnoverload and this could occur if your flat footed etc its pretty spot on
""
so of course post figuring this out i bought some bigger running shoes and im hoping this could help they are made for over pronated feet to so theyre much more supported my question is will this help solve this injury that seems to keep happening over and over i know i ultimately need to see a podiatrist and ill be happy to once all of this is over i just want to get a sense for how things will go down i guess
""
i also am curious how a flat foot can cause pain in the lateral column this would be a helpful oversight

i have a deviated septum thats a fact but ive noticed that my right side of my face has a bone on the side that i guess holds up the actual cartilage for some reason the bone on my right side of the face is larger and it might be why i cant breathe correctly along with the deviated septum
""
i dont know if this is important or not but my right ear is missing some type of bone skin idk that holds up normal headphones my left ear i can wear headphones without them falling out no problem but my right they always fall out with any slight head bobbing at all
""
is the right side of my face deformed or something cant breathe out of my right nostril and my ear is missing something that holds normal headphones up
""
i wanted to try the nostril thing out so i put my finger on my nose gross i know and i can fit a thumb into my left nostril but my right is blocked by the deviated septum itself and the bone right next to it i also felt my literal face and the right bone was closer to the end of my nose than my left
""
what could this be is my face deformed on the right side and could it be affecting other right parts of my face andor body it seems as if the left part of my face is normal which is kind of freaking me out idk why
""
is it still possible to even get septoplasty even if that right bone is closer is it worth it to get septoplasty im afraid of damn needles and it frightens the hell out of me and ive heard that after a few years it goes back to how it was before the surgery which sounds pointless some people even report breathing worse and their nose being jacked up which frightens me even more

anyways thank you very much for helping me out its worrying so thank you very much

background
""
three days ago i started feeling some pain when i urinated the next morning it felt worse and i also had an increased urge to go when there wasnt anything in there i had one azo test and used it after taking a shower and it came up positive leukocytes and negative nitrites i called a doctor and he gave me a prescription for 500mg of cephalexin every 12 hours and i had cvs deliver it i didnt go to a clinic because of covid concerns so no test was done by a doctor but it felt like other utis about 2 12 months ago i had one that was bad enough to make me pee blood and feel overall terrible before i got meds 100mg macrobid every 12hrs so i wanted to nip this one as quickly as possible before the last one i hadnt had one in a couple years
""
since i was getting meds delivered i had to wait a day so i chugged tons of water and took vitamin c and cranberry capsules over the course of the day the pain subsided a lot and the gotta go burning feeling improved too
""
yesterday morning was much better than the previous morning some pain but not as bad the meds got here and i planned to take them before bed was worried about keeping up with the schedule so continued drinking lots of water and so on had a bit of a dip in the middle of the day with painful gotta go feelings after i just went but that all subsided pretty quickly as i got more fluids in me by the time i was about to take my first dose i hesitated because at that point i felt so much better very very mild pain if any and decided id put it off until next morning i also drank apple cider vinegar which it turns out isnt that great for an irritated bladder but it didnt bother me at all
""
this morning i feel ok some irritation when i went but milder no urgent feelings yet i havent taken any antibiotics yet
""
main question
""
should i still start antibiotics if my uti is feeling better without them can they get better on their own i have the meds ready to go whenever but would hate to start a course of antibiotics if i dont need them at the same time i definitely dont want it to suddenly get worse and know utis arent something to mess with ive been reading kind of conflicting opinions about utis just going away and was hoping for some advice no fever or flank pain or anything at any point during all this just some pain when going and the offandon urgent feelings i described

""

i had a laparoscopic surgery a little over 2 weeks ago my belly is fine it stopped hurting after the 5th day however my shoulder pain seems to be getting worse i often cant even lift my head without help because it hurts too bad and now the pain seems to be traveling down my right arm the pain has been constant since the surgery so i doubt it could be from anything else

it is only relieved by taking bayer back and body which is weird because how is that relieving gas pain and also i already take 12 prescribed medications i dont like taking 6 more on top of that every day

i tried contacting my doctor multiple times but its been very hard to get in touch with him i also tried looking online but i cant find any information on gas pain 1 week after surgery let alone 2

any advice is helpful

edit i do walk around normally once the bayer kicks in so thats out of the equation i also used heat and ice in the beginning heat worked a bit but not enough to continue use as heating pads make me anxious ive tried to sleep with my feet elevated but its too uncomfortable to sleep in that position

hello for the past 3 days ive had pain on the outside of my right nostril the inside of my nose doesnt hurt at all only the outside when i gently press on it there is maybe a little bit of swelling but not enough to really notice a difference there is very little redness and i have no other signs of any infection the pain does not extend anywhere else it is only on the cartilage of the outside of my right nostril it almost feels like a bruise but there is no sign of that
there has been no trauma to my nose recently
im 57 and 125lbs i dont smoke im on birth control and i have had an iron deficiency for around 5 years
my nose is actually broken i broke it before i turned 1 and it has never affected me so i dont think this is because of that the break is on the bridge of my nose and isnt too severe but i am getting surgery to fix it soon
so i 24f no preexisting health conditions otherwise healthy was chilling home today as usual and just sort of felt a little bit of an uncomfortable feeling in my throat its not exactly sore but i can feel the very slight discomtort it doesnt hurt at all to swallow but i can sort of feel some itchyness and it doesnt feel all good i havent been going out in public except for going out to my boyfriends place on weekends and his family is pretty health conscious and only seem to go out if absolutely necessary however i am a bit paranoid of coronavirus because my mother has been going out frequently to the shops and stuff  sometimes unnecessarily to get clothes she wears a mask and gloves and says shes being cautious and clean she also works a lot but at night where she isnt exposed to many people myself though ive been home lately and just felt this uncomfortable throat feeling today so im a little anxious other than that i have some sneezing too and runny nose i guess im just really anxious as ive been hearing stories of people getting coronavirus very mild symptoms and then suddenly get worse the next day its 11pm and because of the stories ive heard im afraid to go to sleep in case i get worse what could it be just seasonal allergy i just havent had a throat feeling when i get my allergy symptoms i need some reassurance or something  thank you

this doesnt look all that serious compared to other topics but i couldnt find anywhere else to go so here goes
""
i hit my elbow against the sharp side of the doorknob i had to sit down as i was getting dizzy from the pain it was as if it pierced precisely between two muscles or bones
""
i thought it was just an extreme reaction to hitting my funny bone but after 3 minutes or so
a very big wobbly sack was formed on the spot
it looked not good like a foot turned the otherside around
""
however as quickly as it came it gone away again my whole arm was kinda numb for the rest of the evening yesterday with that electric feeling
""
right now it just looks like a very tiny bruise and im not too worried
""
im just really curious about what this sudden lump was it reached about 15 cm in height if i were to guess usually when you hit yourself and you get a bad bruise a lump grows and heals overtime right this thing grew to concerning proportions in seconds and shrunk likewise

even though i would probably be considered an ok fitness level my heart always reacts to exercise severely as in whenever i do cardio my heart rate picks up very quickly and im no stranger to exercise i usually work out around 45 times per week mixing up cardio hiit and strength training recently i noticed that my heart rate is noticeably irregular whenever my pulse quickens as in first it beats really fast and then kind of lags for 23 beats and then starts beating fast again is this something i should be worried about

i started with a slight pressure headache yesterday not long after waking up and pressure in the left side of my nose and i could feel slight movement right at the top and slight irritation maybe a bit of mucous production idk but due to being unable to blow my nose as a child ive always kind of sniffed backwards so now unless im really snotty the mucous tends to run backwards into my throat it gradually got worse but depended on the position and elevation of my head not blinding pain but definitely very unpleasant
""
last night i tried to go to sleep and everytime i laid down on my back or side the pressure was awful both in my nose and around and under the back of my head it eased off a bit and i managed to go to sleep but today the same thing is happening if i roll my head in a circle the pain appears in different places depending on the position of my head and the pressure at the top of my nose is constant its still not a blinding pain but it hurts a lot
""
now for the possibly silly question  yesterday morning when i woke up the first day of the pressurepain my nose stud had disappeared and theres no sign of it it could just be that its hard to find as it was just a tiny silver bar with a gem on the end but the tinyness of it has me worried that maybe its disappeared up through my nose i cant feel any kind of object up there but im worried that its gone waaaay further up if thats even possible would i be able to feel that there was something stuck up there or could it just present as pressure after a certain point
""
its the length of the headache and the painpressure level changing depending on positionelevation that has me worried again im sorry if this is silly but im just worried

called up local physician that i had gone to for previous physical i live in nj the clinic is not doing in person appointments only over the phone i explained i have been dealing with a cough for over a month around 56 weeks it has gotten worse over the last week i told them i did not have fever but a really bad cough and that because of the length of time with the cough my chestairways have become irritated ive had pneumonia previously so i am familiar with the feeling of pretty intense coughing fits although when i did have it around 21 im 27 now i had a fever phlegm and a way worse cough this does not feel anywhere near as bad
""
the dr prescribed z pack as well as benzonatate for the cough
""
is prescribing the z pack completely a preventative measure and if so is that beneficial i am reluctant to antibiotics i usually have pretty bad side affects with them if there is no fever or any indication of a bacterial infection as it was over the phone is this a normal protocol i did some research after the fact and if i am dealing with something viral then this will not have any affect i always hear about the downside to being over prescribed antibiotics and am wondering if this is an example of that or is it not unconventional to take it as a preventative measure and to rule out possibility of bacterial infection in the first place

sorry for such a vulgar question
""
for the last month or so i have had mild spotting after masturbating with the risk of being tmi i use a small bullet vibrator exclusively on my clitoris and am able to achieve orgasmmultiple orgasms
""
when i use the bathroom afterwards i always notice i have a little blood i am 100 without a doubt positive that it is from my vaginacervixuterus as the blood is only present when i wipe deep inside my vaginal canal as opposed to on my vulva
""
no real pain only a small amount of blood and its short lived but still wtf
""
what could cause this
""
edit also i have a very regular period and did not just finish nor am i due to start soon
so i 20f always have great colitorise orgasms but i have a problem whenever my colitorise or any other part of my vagina and vulva gets wet when aroused it becomes sooooo sensitive to touch it just feels like a intense sensation all over my body and i kinda shake with each touch i feel a sudden muscle tighness in my belly and then it spreads its like a beat in my belly that affects my whole body
its completely non sexual and its pure pain and discomfort its something like the pain and shock you feel if your vaginavulva get touched after orgasm
then if i dry my colitorise or labia all of the sudden it becomes ok again and i can again touch it
and i have to add this doesnt happen that much with water but with thicker liquids like my own body fluids
this exact feeling of discomfort and shock happened to me when my partner tried to give me oral sex i even ended up crying
more informations
i never had any problemslike infections or anything with my vagina vulvauterus
i dont have abnormal discharge or anything that stinks or has an unusual color
my periods are painful but thats something normal in my family
im still a virgin not even fingering
ive always been active but i always practiced safe sex and i had check ups and blood tests several times all ok
i dont use any specific med
overall im healthy and i have a open mindset about sex so its not anything psychological
i dont know where else to go during covid so i am going to try my luck posting here it all started 3 years ago after i had 2 major ear infections in both of my ears i am a huge music fan so not being able to fully enjoy music for an extended period of time was hard for me
""
during recovery i began to find my vision was changing it was becoming harder to focus on certain objects and i developed visual snow a constant static that covers my field of vision major points of contrast such as edges of logos or text on signs shimmer in my vision making it difficult to read
""
even after my ears had fully recovered my sense of hearing was never really the same they feel full and it feels like i am unable to hear silence anymore directional sound is almost gone its hard for me to tell where sounds are coming from and from how far
""
the eye doctor says i have perfect vision he tells me to use screens less though i already know thats not the problem the visual snow still persists
""
the ent says i have perfect hearing and no blockage or complications in either ear
""
i used to be a very creative happy funny person but after this has happened to me ive become very distant and numb i have brain fog poor short term memory its hard to stay present and in the moment or even enjoy or experience things i have poor control over my mental chalkboard or any thoughts at all for that matter
""
when i go to work i can often zone out for hours on end eyes glazed over im there but not really a zombie it feels like the moments before youre about to fall asleep youre there but drifting emotionless my ears dont work as i want my eyes dont work as i want i have little to no sense of smell im not present enough to enjoy taste or experience touch its like all absence of senses is being filled in
""
for example i cannot see pitch black lack of light because the graininess flashing in my eyes like when you stare at the sun or a bright light only covering my entire field of vision lack of vision is filled in with flashing static
""
i cant hear silence sometimes its tinnitus sometimes its bodily noises or breathing or ambient sound but it takes up all hearing capacity i can no longer hear the air between the sources of sound lack of hearing is being filled in with tinnitus or overloaded by the sounds being heard
""
i cannot think or live in the present moment because it feels like my brain is at full capacity or that i am being pushed out lack of thought is being filled in with brain fog and subconscious thought

in july of last year i experienced what was thought to be a complex focal seizure since february of this year ive experienced 5 of these episodes i had 2 eegs done both coming back completely normal both awake and asleep my neurologist heard that during one of these episodes i turned completely white and now he thinks its an issue with my heart and is sending me to a cardiologist asap to receive a holter monitor ive already had 2 ecgs and i was told they were both normal but the actual results both indicated nondiagnostic peaked p waves during these episodes i dont pass out but i completely lose my memorybecome nonresponsive for 510 seconds and then experience a sort of dissociation for hours afterwards and get very tired my blood pressure is seemingly normal and as well as my blood test besides being high in b12
i have severe adhd and during 2 of the episodes i was on 70mg of foquest methylphenidate hydrochloride and during 1 episode i was on 40mg of vyvanse lisdexamphetamine i was on topiramate for migraines for almost 4 weeks in march but stopped due to the side effects ive also been experiencing a painful pressing sensation at the back of my head for the past 5 months and have had nonstop ringing in my ears for the past few weeks
i dont drink smoke or use drugs recreationally my paternal grandfather has had 3 strokes and is on a pacemaker and my paternal grandmother died before the age of 50 due to ovarian cancer and both her and my dad carry the brca1 gene unaware if i do my maternal aunt had childhood absence seizures
i was confused to hear that this might be a heart issue does this sound like anything in particular like mitral regurgitation are these actually just focal seizures can heart issues make you dissociate and lose your memory very confused please help

i have a slight pain above my right testicle and im not sure why i havent had sex so i know its not a sti or std a few days it was there but went away a few minutes after also its been 3 days since i havent masterbated and felt this pain the day after
hi my 19 year old daughter went to her primary doc yesterday bc she has a large lump under her skin the size of a small orange shes in extreme pain and running a fever of around 100 her doc said it was an infected sweat gland and put her on a 10 day antibioticsdoxycycline 100mg this morning she has been feeling a lot worse she now has a sore throat body aches and has been vomiting but i know the antibiotics will upset an empty stomach obviously im worried that this could be more than an infected sweat gland does this sound like a typical infection or could this be something more serious like covid
ive had swollen sinuses congestion very occasional and mild sinus pain and a horrible smell coming from my nose every day the smell only after 23 pm since october about 7 weeks ago i was finally prescribed antibiotics and corticosteroid nasal drops by an ent who said i most likely had a sinus infection both for 28 days a day later the congestion and horrible smell were gone the smell reappeared weakly on the third day and since then has been gone completely my nose doesnt smell anymore its not congested but i noticed my sinuses are still swollen and i still get mildmoderate sinus pain for a few minutes most days
is this likely to go away on its own its been almost 3 weeks since finishing the antibiotics and nasal drops i have a sinus ct scan coming up but because of covid19 its been cancelled

hi there im trying to figure out what could be causing my chest tightness and difficulty breathing as initial info i tested negative for covid19 last week and havent had other significant symptoms within the last few weeks
""
about a month ago i started having chest tightnessshortness of breath that was worse when i laid down i also had a somewhat constant headache for about a week but no fever my cardiologist started me on lasix and i lost 5 pounds the respiratory symptoms went away shortly after starting the lasix but came back around two weeks ago
""
currently when i first wake up in the morning my breathing feels fine once i start moving around a bit and going out to walk my dog i feel the chest tightness start and have difficulty breathing it feels like i have to take multiple deep breaths in order to get one that is a full breath its not awful and my pulse ox stays at 99 or 100 but its uncomfortable all day
""
i had an ekg and echocardiogram yesterday and they were both unchanged from my normal so its nothing cardiac increasing the dose of lasix also didnt do anything the symptoms havent improved using atrovent or flovent so it doesnt seem like asthma
""
does anyone have any suggestions on what could be causing it my pcp suggested it could be from a muscle pull but i havent really done any activity that i would think could cause that could it be that i had covid19 earlier on and its been so long that i tested negative but am still having symptoms or anxietyrelated basically any other avenues to look toward would be really helpful for me in resolving this  thank you
so i 20f always have great colitorise orgasms but i have a problem whenever my colitorise or any other part of my vagina and vulva gets wet when aroused it becomes sooooo sensitive to touch it just feels like a intense sensation all over my body and i kinda shake with each touch i feel a sudden muscle tighness in my belly and then it spreads its like a beat in my belly that affects my whole body
its completely non sexual and its pure pain and discomfort its something like the pain and shock you feel if your vaginavulva get touched after orgasm
then if i dry my colitorise or labia all of the sudden it becomes ok again and i can again touch it
and i have to add this doesnt happen that much with water but with thicker liquids like my own body fluids
this exact feeling of discomfort and shock happened to me when my partner tried to give me oral sex i even ended up crying
more informations
i never had any problemslike infections or anything with my vagina vulvauterus
i dont have abnormal discharge or anything that stinks or has an unusual color
my periods are painful but thats something normal in my family
im still a virgin not even fingering
ive always been active but i always practiced safe sex and i had check ups and blood tests several times all ok
i dont use any specific med
overall im healthy and i have a open mindset about sex so its not anything psychological
about 2 months ago i had a bad experience with smoking weed and havent really been the same ever since the day after i did it i felt the head fogginess all day which lead to headaches and just kinda put me out of it this has happened once to me before after smoking but it only lasted the next day and then i was fine after that however this time its been lingering still 2 months later and pretty constant ringing ears have come along with it the ringing ears didnt really start until i went to a loud concert so i think that might be part of the explanation for the ears however im wondering what could be going on and why im still getting these headaches and head fogginess here and there about two months later any suggestions on what to do would be great and what might really be going on i went to the doctor a couple weeks after it happened and they cudnt find anything going on but since the covid outbreak havent been able to go back in

usa  ive been diagnosed recently with hpv ive noticed for a while that ill occasionally get hemorrhoids im overweight and have a desk job so im sitting all day that causes itching to the point of bleeding or a moist anal area from being overweight discharge i shower regularly and try to keep dry ive thought about it possibly being worms least likely to it becoming cancer i found this out because i would put antiitch cream for yeast infections around and inside the opening of my anus and felt something kinda hard and pointy in my anus probably a half of inch in am i overreacting and being a hypochondriac or what do you think it could be id like a general ballpark of what it may be before i consider going to a doctor as i have a very high deductible plan
when im at my parents i breath clearly and rarely have any phlegm or stuffy nose but i got back to my house at my college and now i have to constantly blow my nose and spit out phlegm i like to think im healthy but this has been persistent for awhile now
have a dull aching pain behind the left testicle feeling around makes me feel that the epididymis or the area around that region is tenderer kinda concerned as i had a history of it hurting but went for a checkup to find nothing and the ultrasound showed nothing as well

for a couple of months ive been having issues with my throat just feeling gross and i had some tonsil stones i started brushing my tongue on someones advice which helped almost immediately maybe about two weeks ago i noticed this red lump in the back of my throat and was wondering what it is and if i should be concerned i have a mild feeling of my ear being blocked constantly and i think the two are related though im not sure the lump doesnt hurt or anything nor does it prevent me from swallowing properly i heard most cancer lumps dont hurt so i was worried and what kind of doctor would i go to if i wanted to get this checked out thank you for any advice

hey all first time posting here and a tad worried mostly because im asking about an issue ive suffered for about a week now thats a bit embarrasing to say
""
recently i have started to get painful erections and painful climax whenever i have fun with myself i was sure it was down to me doing it too much but i noticed a bump on the left of my male part that hurts to touch it doesnt change the appearance of my male part but it is noticible if you feel around the area also whenever i do have an erection it hurts to move my body cause it seems theres stabbing pains around the groin and through the middle of my male part
""
i tried searching up what it could be and everywhere i look it seems to be peyronies disease but im unsure if it is i dont know what to do but im embarressed to ask for help from family

so about a month ago i had a bad experience with smoking weed and i havent really felt the same since the day after i felt foggy in the head all day and it caused me to get tired and get a headache this happened once before to me after i did it but it only lasted a day this time i still feel that head fogginess on and off and get headaches a lot more the ringing ears didnt start until a week or two later after i went to a loud concert so im assuming that has something to do with that portion i went to the doctor a couple weeks after the incident who didnt find anything to be wrong and said to take tylenol for the headaches and see if everything goes away it has not completely gone away and still throws me off in my everyday life i would love to hear anything about what might be going on here and what things i can do to try and resolve this
first of all im not alergic
i have grastitis and prediabetes but i exercise everyday and have a pretty healthy diet since february these symptoms usually happen when i eat bananas which have a bit more of a sour taste others around me can eat it and feel fine but i feel terrible it does not happen when i eat very sweet bananas though when i have these symptoms my temperature also gets a bit higher than normal but never high enough to be considered fever
what could it be
i used to have these symptoms a lot before the change in my diet and exercise but some things like banana still makes me feel this way

around september i developed a mild rash in both my armpits i thought it was irritation from shaving but it didnt get better when i stopped ive i had it continuously since then it has gotten worse and slightly better off and on the whole time but has never went away it primarily consists of the red ring in the photos but at one point it also developed dozens of huge draining boils that spread all the way down to my waist and across my breasts those went away with the first round of antibiotics
""
i have been to the doctor twice and been put on clindamycin for 2 weeks doxycycline for 2 weeks and nystatin cream the only improvement is that the boils are gone i have stopped shaving tried trimming the hair instead used coconut oil changed soaps changed detergents tried hundreds of dollars in new deodorants powders antiperspirants etc tried detox masks apple cider vinegar the surgical wound care cleaner stuff vitamins every remedy i have found online or been suggested by a doctor to no avail
""
the rash is pretty painful it feels like very raw skin and it also smells so bad which is my biggest issue ive never had any issues with body odor in my life and now i smell horrible all the time even right out of the shower its so embarrassing
""
my doctor is at a loss and there are no dermatologists accepting patients anywhere around here so thats not even an option

thanks for reading and in advance for your help

hi everyone

im a 35 year old male 6 feet tall 330 lbs currently type 2 diabetic with a stressful soul crushing job im trying to leave ive dealt with depression and anxiety for the majority of my life but have found ways to manage it and overcome a lot of it
i am currently taking metformin for diabetes i was diet and exercise controlled for 5 years until i fell off the wagon and 60 mg of fluoxetine daily
""
the issue is my wife and i only have sex maybe 3 times a month generously i have very little desire for sex i very rarely ever get turned on by anything anymore i masturbate maybe once a month and have recently forced it in the hopes it would kickstart something i barely get erections anymore its like i just dont see anything how i used to porn is boring and kind of silly nudity on tv is just nudity all im doing is gaining weight and feeling pathetic im trying to exercise more but i just have such little will to do anything i feel like i have zero testosterone like im just a sack of potatoes lol
""
im considering lessening my fluoxetine to eventually wean myself off but im just curious if this is somewhat common in others who have taken it or if any doctors have advice im very happy in my marriage i love my wife to death but i know its hard on her and i just want to feel like myself again
""
could it be the weight gain could the weight gain be from fluoxetine too ive taken it for about 2 years now i think

 been going on for 5 months
 pain every time i type or use my phone pain starts in lt 10 minutes of beginning activity
 some days warmth and burning sensation in forearms
 some days nerve pain through forearm and tingling in hands
 pain can be in wrists forearm body or hands
 most commonly down wrists and forearms on flexor tendon side
 lots of wrist cracking
 i have splinted rested for weeks and do light isometric and eccentric exercises nothing seems to help
 i use a wrist rest and an ergonomic chair they dont help at all
 have taken nsaids only help on the days i take them
""
shoulders
""
 tight and knotted every day typically after waking up
 crack a lot
 pain subsides sometimes when im able to crack shoulder or massage the muscles
 shoulder joints feel loose and unstable
 progressed over a couple of years beginning with cracking
 sometimes pain gets referred down the arm
 pain usually closer to neck side of the shoulder
""
ive ceased all offending activities using my phone much during the day using the computer at all cooking cleaning or carrying any weights and yet my pain has become worse with time
""
i am due to start working as a software developer soon and am completely lost about how i can do that if my wrists get angry with the slightest typing id appreciate any insights as i am desperate thank you

she is healthy in all other respects non smoker taking no medication her development is fine her weight and height are above average nothing else is wrong

hi im a 22 year old man from asia i am currently living with my grandmother who is suffering from liver cirrhosis and liver cancer the cause of the liver cancer was indeterminate when doctors investigated her about 3 or 4 years back however today something happened that possibly freaked me out
""
my grandmother is a diabetic and insulin dependent she is 74 and usually i change the needles on her insulin injection pen today due to a lapse of concentration i did not notice that the needle she had used last night had been bent and it was poking out of the plastic cap that it was supposed to be in i ended up with a very short prick on my thumb which i immediately withdrew from the needle there was no blood and i washed it under running water then soap
""
im absolutely terrified that liver cancers are mostly caused by hep c viral infections something which i read up on the internet anyone have any advice for me

i am a 24yearold caucasian female 52 weighing 125 pounds i began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder in 2014 to be more specific it is a burning pain that starts in the very center of my shoulder joint and runs through the trapezius muscle up into my neck at its worst it is burning tight intense pain as a constant it is tight and achy i was working a fast food job and chalked it up to being a result of repetitive moments and reaching above my head hundreds of times throughout a shift the pain kept worsening however and i couldnt find any relief i tried heating pads and cold compresses otc pain relivers stretching etc
""
after multiple rounds of physical therapy and cortisone injections i was told i needed surgery this was because my shoulder blade was too large and was rubbing against my ribcage and the doctor said i also had a bone spur near my trapezius muscle i had my first surgery in may of 2015 they removed part of my shoulder blade and the bone spur
""
months later i was still in pain worse if not the same i went back to the surgeon and he ran some imaging and found that my body had grown another bone spur in response to taking the other one out he said this was very rare but that it does happen in some cases so fast forward to another surgery in the summer of 2017
""
im still in pain everyday i saw a pain management doctor sometime after my last surgery and he just wanted to put me on muscle relaxers which i do not want to live on and only took a couple of times after that appointment i havent done anything about it since i did change careers in 2018 and i was really hoping this would help i work at a desk for 8 hours a day and yet im still in horrible pain things that make it much worse are driving throwing a ball playing piano lifting anything walking the dog breathing basically
""
my trap gets so tight it feels like it could snap at times i have to have my husband push his thumb into it to release the tension and make the pain somewhat manageable the pain in my shoulder now aches all the way through to my elbow and my neck is constantly tight as well
""
i was hoping for recommendations as to what to do next my doctor tragically passed away so i dont know if i should go to another orthopedic doctor for an opinion try physical or massage therapy etc i forgot to mention that i have already tried going to the chiropractor as well i went twice a week for a good amount of time and found no relief from that either is this a pain i could be potentially living with for the rest of my life or is there still hope please let me know what you would do or try next i would greatly appreciate it
i burned myself last night with boiling water theres some peeling skin but overall it doesnt look too bad ive had sudocrem and cling film over it today but is it better to let it dry out thanks
relatively well controlled diabetes a1c of 74 but the past week ive had really high unexplained glucose levels especially at night also have an unexplained rash on my side i had kidney blood work done about two months ago and everything was normal healthy vegan diet but i have been drinking lots of wine any help is appreciated

i had some kidney stones removed a few years ago and the first thing the doctor said to me was well that didnt go as planned which is not the alarming part everybodys body is different so its a new adventure every time you head inside of someone but i was curious about when he said he pushed the stone back into my kidney and how often something like that happens
i am 29 female that weighs 133 pounds i had loose stool and noticed that when i wiped there was a lot of clear mucus on the paper

my serum iron is 50 17 saturation

the iron is basically low and the ferritin is high what could cause this does this indicate potential colon malignancy should i continue to worry about colon cancer

the waiting period considering no elective procedures is giving me anxiety people say it takes 10 years for cancer to develop in colon or rectum but i feel like more and more people in their twenties are getting it so i dont understand i dont have any family history

i have a question about if this could be a type of afib
ive noticed that when im laying down i will have occasional episodes lasting only a few seconds of my heart feeling like its fluttering out of my chest this also sometimes happens after i eat and then lay down when i change positions it goes away just last night i laid on my back and got a few second episode of it rarely happens when im standing or sitting up i never feel dizzy or light headed i can exercise just fine after these episodes my pulse is quite high for a few seconds then returns to normal quickly
""
ive had ekgs done before which show nothing other than borderline left atrium enlargement my doctor said she wasnt worried about that yet

i of course did some googling and i found out theres a type of afib called vagus afib where that nerve becomes irritated and causes the heart to misfire i couldnt find a lot of info on it though

5 days ago my dad developed a fever hes a rather irregular smoker but after taking steam he smoked a cigarette and since then hes been having fever had sore throat earlier on with productive cough but a little cough medication helped along with lots of steam and a decoction of ginger turmeric and black cumin looks like plain pharyngitis gave him paracetamol 500mg along with azithromycin 500mg od and its been three days now but his temperature revolves around 100 f and after taking paracetamol comes down for about 23 hours then hops back up to 100 f im confused as to what should be done got fbcesrmp widal ns1 done and even that is normal what should i do now
i 25 f 160 lbs 56 using nicotine cessation products for three months only med i take is propanolol as needed woke up on the middle of the night on sunday 2am with the most horrific pain ive ever experienced it started kind of below my ribs and then radiated down to behind my belly button when it first started it was maybe a six or a seven out of ten pain wise so i took some antacids and tried to sleep but the pain just got worse and worse it was the first time ive ever felt ten out of ten pain on the pain scale i thought i was dying i went to the er but the wait was so long that by the time i was going to be taken back it was 10 am and the pain had subsided to the point i could walk again so i left my abdomen still feels tender and i have zero appetite went back yesterday just to double check they palpated my stomach and said it is most likely my appendix because i said it hurt when they pushed on my appendix i will say that i was in so much pain sunday that my entire stomach area is really sensitive now and i had difficulty communicating about residual pain had a ct with contrast and blood and urine testing all my tests came back normal they also said they didntsee anything on the ct except a small amount of fluid in my pelvis and around my appendix but no real signs of infection and that my stomach and gallbladder both look ok they did a pelvic exam as well and apparently i was all good on that front i am feeling better but my abdomen still feels tender and off they said to come back in today so they can recheck me in case anything has changed but after all the exams last night i cant really afford another round of testing and if this is likely to resolve on its own im willing to tough it out any advice or questions to ask the doctor today if i go are appreciated

i am a 16m 64 160lb white diagnosed ocdgad prescribed fluoxetine 20mgs regular cannabis user i have had a recurring rash that lasts 530 minutes occuring every time i sweat it has been going on for about 2 months now and has been worsening significantly from mild discomfort at first to an all encompassing sensation of skin tightness prickling pain and itching now it looks like a heat rash red skin tiny red bumps all over and it goes away either when i stop sweating or within 30 minutes but it comes back whenever i sweat it has reduces my quality of life significantly since i cant focus on anything when the first wave of discomfort hits it comes in waves that are debilitatingly intense for the first couple but after that subsequent waves become progressively less intense any help as to what it is and what i can do about it i tried a face wash on my body but it barely helped
so ive had an issue it came on suddenly with a bunch of other issues about a year and a half ago where my feet all day every day are drenched with sweat and freezing cold like theyve been dunked in an ice bath its actually kinda painful cold i try wearing thin breathable socks to let the moisture evaporate but the sweat is so heavy it socks the thin sock and my feet get even colder i try wearing thick socks so theyre protected from the cold but eventually they get soaked through and go the same way itll take about 15 minutes to soak through a thick pair of socks from when i put them on
""
i wash them every day i keep them clean and i try to let them air dry but they start sweating before theyre fully dry ive tried using antiperspirant and baby powder and both go the same way just soaked through within minutes

he told me hed put a tube in that ear but by his own admission he said it may not help and could make it worse he said he didnt see any infection but without more testing he just doesnt know
""
the pain is significant and gives me radiating head pain i sit with my painful ear tilted up naturally and its so irritated i cant even put headphones in
""
i mean will this tube help even if it doesnt help could it possibly make it worse im just afraid if my doctor isnt even sure that i could do more damage than good
so recently within the past few months i have noticed these weird bumps on my butt theyre in the area where the butt kind of becomes a leggoes towards the private area
""
the bumps are light pink and theyre not full if that makes sense theres nothing to pop in them theyre pretty squishy i dont know what to compare it to but if i put my finger on it i can move it around and there feels like its on top a hollow area in the skintissue beneath
""
ive tried popping them many times and its impossible to squeeze because its this squishy piece of flimsy bump and i dont know how to work around it theyre bigger than the size of an average skin size theyre around the size of a pimple mostly but they are definitely not pimples they dont hurt at all im just curious as to what they arehow to get rid of them
""
im a 5 feet tall 200 lb female and most of my weight is in my butt and leg area so it might be due to friction or something i work as a delivery driver and my work pants are kind of tight and im constantly walking around and getting in and out of my car ive noticed that as i gained more weight is when the bumps appeared

any clue

my husband has an annoying obsession with me drinking water he never thinks its enough
despite the color of my urine being near clear all the time hes not convinced i drink enough
""
is there any sort of urological type of standard i can show him as to how much water i should be drinking
what is not enough
what is too much
what are the signs im drinking too muchlittle water
can drinking too muchlittle water cause an electrolyte imbalance

im looking for cold hard facts about water consumption and not psychologicaltherapy suggestions with my husband
part of his obsession is due to the fact i am overweight according to bmi and hes convinced that drinking more water will help me lose weight not the cico i focus on which is a topic for another subreddit

i believe i have some kind of yeast infection within my digestive system it began last summer and has coming and going possibly influenced by my diet i was very stressed at the time which i believe weakened my bodys immune system and led to this illness i remember when it started i felt ok but i was burping a good amount and the burps tasted funny  kind of like lucky charms without marshmallows and my stool was either soft or loose i took probiotic pills about once a day for 12 weeks and all symptoms went away i thought that my gut was in balance again and life could return to normal
""
yet it seemed to come back every time i went to my moms place where i would indulge in sweets so i just went back on the pills for a bit and made a note to avoid excessive sweets around christmas i read somewhere that acid is a natural enemy of yeast so i began putting slices of lemon in my morning tea and being generous with vinegar in meals i cooked and i cannot remember any problems for the following months
""
most recently i made brownies for me and my roommate and i had a piece every day for a week i thought it might be okay if i increase my acid intake so i had lemon slices in my tea every day but it didnt work i have had softloose stool almost every bowel movement for the past 23 weeks i started on the probiotic pills again less frequently this time but with little improvement i think i will go back to taking it every day until all is well
""

""
at this point i do not know what to think of this i have continued with the belief that this is a yeast infection but am wondering if something else is the matter why would it keep coming back i consider going to the doctor but during times i experience no symptoms i think why bother would they find anything

my endocrinologist the dr that ordered the test had told me to see an internist about this and seems somewhat concerned but hes an alarmist i have an appointment with an internist in two weeks but im spiraling i cant stop doing research my main ocd compulsion and am terrified of nafld or some other liver condition i also cant figure out if this could be because of my increase medication dosages all around im completely panicked and could use some input on the situation thank you
im not on good terms with my mother she left us a decade ago and we dont have a relationship anymore so i cant ask her or her doctor but i would like to understand the prognosis for the situation
52 f caucasian never smoked but drank heavily when i was growing up she was born with aortic stenosis and has had 4 open heart surgeries the last one was to repair a large ascending aortic aneurysm they repaired 4 of the aorta and moved 3 gray vessels to the side of the aorta this happened late 2018early 2019 when she woke up her kidneys failed and she was on dialysis which eventually started working
then in march 2019 she had a stroke which hit the left right and back of her brain followed by another stroke and 2 seizures in october 2019 where she had to be life flighted and flat lined a couple times
shes now in the hospital again after suffering another stroke
i copy and pasted almost all of that from messages from other family members so if any of it sounds incorrect my apologies
""
what kind of lifespan do people typically have after a surgery like that and after having so many complications from it
just trying to get an idea so i have time to possibly reconnect if its not sounding good or wait for her to reach out if she knows its getting to that point

hi i sprained my ankle 5 months ago i had taken an mr and it showed partial anterior talofibular ligament tear after my mr i should have gotten a response from my doctor but i guess this is nothing serious if he did not contact me after it the pain went away around like 6 weeks after the injury so i could walk amp even run painfree after that i had just discomfort when having on some types of socks especially shoes or when exercising ex deep squat now 5 months later there is still the same discomfort i wonder if this is something that will eventually go away or i should check that out

any ideas
a few months ago a ct stonogram revealed that i have a 03 stone lodged in my ureter for three months i took meds to dissolve it but they remained inside me i think so because i still get the same stomachaches from when the stone wasnt discovered yet now i dont know if that has something to do with my current problem
knowing that i have a stone inside me and with the covid19 still prevalent we opted not to visit a hospital to treat the stone so i just kept on drinking water in the hopes of urinating the stone
but today its just weird that while i empty my bladder i feel some pain on the right side of my head
now with the fear of getting covid i cant visit hospitals yet and and im also afraid that this pain in the right side of my head may be something serious
i hope a professional replies
thank you

im not short of breath so much my heart isnt racing my bp doesnt seem too high or too low oxygen has been relatively normal no light headedness no fever my lungs just hurt when i take a breath it gets intense the more active i am resting in bed seems to be the best way to keep the pain down

i have two days left on the steroid pack ive called my doctor back and left a message with the nurse i would expect that id feel better at this point now let me clarify my lungs actually do feel better than when i started the pack but with two days left i thought id feel a lot better and certainly not worse today than yesterday

i cleaned between my legs and scrotum too rough and rubbed it raw it was red and wet and had a smell like fish somewhat
""
i went to the er got antibiotics took them all and put triple antibiotic cream on the area too
""
the smell went away for a little while but where i put the triple antibiotic started to itch and my skin wrinkled and peeled a little bit the fish strong smell is back and its embarrassing
""
the initial wound is just about completely healed
""
did the skin on my leg peel because the area couldnt breathe and stayed wet with triple antibiotic and why does it smell just as strong as when i first injured it what should i do what does this mean

i have been on fluoxetine prozac for about 6 months i also suffer from spina bifida my pain relief meds changed today from dihydrocodiene to tramadol and diclofenac
""
in my research i have seen that there are major interactions between tramadol and prozacis this risk too high and dangerous to take together my family doctor hastily changed them over the phone today without running through any risks or concerns that there may be with mixing the two i want to make sure i will be safe in taking them together

this jus happened now and im trying not to cry
""
so about an hour ago i felt the need to poop nothing more than usual except it felt like i was consipated while i was in the middle of doing my buisness must be clear that i probably havent had a bowel movement in a couple days
""
well as soon as it came out so did a bunch of diarhoea it freaked me out a little went to wipe and the poop looked normal but maybe had a hint of blood on the paper i couldnt tell by any other means the poop looked normal other than super runny obviously
""
went on a walk as i started freaking out tried to clear my thoughts almost shat myself when i got home not as much diarrhoea this time but definite blood on the paper no blood in the toilet other than one of the dribbles  of poop that was going into the toilet had a slight tinge of blood
""
now im petrified other than that im a little bloated but i feel completely fine and have done all day
""
could i have caused something to bleed while pushing out the inital poop or did i just have bloody diarrhoea should i go to the hospital
id like to start by saying im not sure if this is the place to ask and im not anorexic or anything like that im 18f and ive just felt really sick for the past few days today i ate something that really isnt settling well in my stomach and now i feel more nauseous than ever the issue is i hadnt throw up in over 5 years even at training a few months ago when i could barely move from how nauseous i felt i was sitting there like a cat trying to cough up a hair ball and still nothing came up my body just doesnt allow me to throw up ive tried the finger gag method and all that happened was a lot of saliva and nothing else im hoping throwing up will make me feel better as ive been trying to get some homework done for the past hour and a half but every time i get into it i get the feeling of throwing up and nothing happens if throwing up isnt the solution i am open to other suggestions on what could help my stomach feel less sick i just want to be able to get my works done and stop feeling so nauseous
so this morning when i was pooping i was obviously peeing also but it was taking too long and i forced my pee out im a male and it stung kinda burned a bit i know its not stds bc i got tested 34 months ago and im clean and i havent had sex since so when i got up and looked there was blood in the water and now when i pee it stings along my shaft but the pain starts in the middle of my shaft any help on what it could be
ive been going to the bathroom more often the past 2 days and sometimes even wet myself without feeling the need to pee its really embarresing considering it sometimes happen in school im a 14 almost 15 year old female and i dont have any type of medical condition or health issue one thing i can think of though is diabetes type 2 since ive heard bladder issues is a sign but i think i would feel a lot worse if that was the case i have been eating more and more sugar and junk food the last couple of months if thats also nessecarily to know could it other than that be some kind of infection perhaps id really appriciate any advice i could get thanks

and sorry for my poor english heh
i hope this is the correct place to ask for advice my mums partner has just been diagnosed with esophageal cancer a couple of days ago theyre waiting on results from a scan to determine how bad is it
""
hes always been into conspiracy theories antivaccination etc but because he thought it was interesting not that he fully believed it all his son has the same views but more extreme and is actively encouraging his dad to forgo conventional treatment and seek alternative therapies
""
my mums partner has basically stopped eating except some nuts and fruit he thinks or hes read that animal meats dairy sugar etc will all feed the cancer and cause it to grow and spread from limited research i think eliminating sugarprocessed foods has merit but my worry is that hes already lost 30lbs over the last 2 months ive read that severe weight loss like this lowers the chances of survival at the 5year point so surely the benefits of maintaining body weight and muscle mass outweigh the risks
""
he has bought a load of alkaline water although it seems like this is just a waste of money and has no health benefits or negatives
""
today he has been talking with a chinese guy who sells herbs and other supposed remedies this guy explicitly told him that he can cure his cancer and not to have any conventional medical treatment he has been given some kind of tea but i dont know what the ingredients are
""
i think that he wants to feel as if hes in control and is looking at these other avenues as if stops him feeling so helpless
""
does anyone have any advice how do i make him get the treatment which gives him the best chance of recovery instead of all this
""
ive found a couple of studies im planning to show him but id like more i want to convince him that these alternatives are potentially dangerous and will do more harm than good ive tried to use logic and reason if the chinese guy had the cure to cancer everyone in the world would know his name hed win the nobel prize  theres a reason why these alternative remedies arent used by the experts etc but to no avail

its been like this since i was 9 years old i never had any issue with it and continued my life normally its look like nothing serious about it but i would be grateful if somebody could identify it or at least make a speculation i dont drink and smoke im sorry if any of my words are difficult to understand as english is not my native language i tried to be clear as possible
so i have noticed recently mostly because ive been wearing t shirts during quarantine that ive had small amounts of nipple discharge ive noticed this because either nipple will occasionally get a cool breeze as you would if you had a wet spot on a t shirt but its never enough to leave an actual wet spot i was actually able to catch it yesterday httpsimgurcompterd4e and it was no bigger than a pin point amount it was a creamy off white but not sticky im wondering if this is because of my birth control or could just be me being 21 and having hormones possibly even due to my nipple piercings 15 years old or just my t shirt rubbing i have no pain from this just curiosity
""

i plan to bring it up at my physical in june im just curious if anyone has heard of this and it not being canceroustumor related
i 18m 6 74 kg indian have been having this problem for at least 6 months now i masturbate ejaculate and then get an urge to pee so i go and a streamj comes out and stops like normal but then the urge doesnt go and theres a slight burning sensation then some more pee comes out every minute or so and this isnt a stream just a small burst of pee this happens a few times and then it stops all my searches have told me its a uti but i really feel like it isnt because its completely irregular and unpredictable some days it happens some days it doesnt happen and it only happens right after masturbation normally theres no burning sensation or anything when i pee and its been happening for so long i dont know what to do

im getting these weird unexplainable rashes on my skin that show up randomly ive always had stomach issues but now im wondering if two and two could go together

i have been experiencing intense and agonizing pain in my stomach like the organ not my abdomen quite a lot lately i used to have this type of pain maybe once a year from 2012 to 2018 but for the last two years its been happening around once a month
""
this is what happens every time i will eat something most of the time it has meat in it but not always it is not always a fatty meal either then a few minutes after the meal i will feel a little heartburn sensation i will then take antiacids but it wont work thats when i know i will be in agonizing pain for the rest of the day a few hours after the meal i will feel intense cramps in my stomach its like contractions when i dont have a contraction my pain level is at a steady 4 or 5 but when the contraction comes and last 1 or 2 minutes max my pain level rises to a huge 10 it is unbearable and i dont have nausea either just huge stomach cramps and pain the cramps and pain also travel to by back so when i lay on my back it hurts
""
i tried everything to calm the pain what is the most effective is putting a hot pad on my stomach but it works only for a short amount of time acetaminophen helps a little bit too but not much eating sometimes reduce the pain for a bit but it always comes back ferociously and sometimes eating makes it worse
""
so i will be in agony for the rest of the day it only goes away during the night i will always have a hard time falling asleep but once i do i am ok when i wake up the next morning its as if nothing ever happened i can eat normally the next day and not feel any pain at all
""
i do not go to the hospital because where i am from it is really long to receive urgent care by the time i would see a doctor it would probably be gone
""
it is so painful i sometimes feel like i could die when it is happening
""
what could it be i dont know what to do about it and it is happening more and more often
for a few months i have had a few small red marks on the right hand side of my chest however recently they seemed to have spread and multiplied there is no itching or discomfort the only thing that makes me fee uncomfortable is the fact they have spreadmerged and multiples recently i have no underlying health conditions

ive been dealing with specific pain in the front of my neck for a while when i tuck my chin in angle my head downwards i get a sharp pain there for the past couple weeks it has always faded in the first hour or so after waking up but today it still comes back sometimes if i angle my head down
""
for about a month ive noticed some light occassional cracking in the back of my neck when i turn it usually after i havent moved it for a while or if im turning it a lot its like the crackling joints do but its new for me it isnt painful
""
i lift weights 5 days a week i deadlift once a week a single working set and have occasionally noticed instead of keeping a neutral spine my head was tilted up so my eyes were pointed straight ahead instead of at the ground however no pain during the movement and this week i did make extra sure to correct this
""
i have also noticed some sort of slight pain in the top of my ribs sternum and it seemed to occasionally be aggravated by lateral delt flies at a time this movement did also cause very light neck crunches though this no longer happens
""
i sleep on my back with a thin pillow as its most comfy it seems logical that this position would be best as it guarantees my chin keeps up going on my side and moving occasionally makes my neck crackle ive slept for months at a time with no pillow on a hard floor and my neck was fine
""
its concerning that this neck pain is lingering through the day today occasionally if i angle my head down and id just like to know how to remedy it because ofc now is not the time to see a gp

tldr is it safe to start exercising on vyvanse after years of being sedentary do i need to ease into it to get my heart used to it should i take any precautions more details below if you want to know why im concerned about it
""

""
""
ive been taking vyvanse for about 15 years now had a previous adderall prescription years ago wanted to try vyvanse instead after having a baby i have been living a pretty sedentary lifestyle since about halfway through my latest pregnancy so about 25 years ago i deeply regret this and would like to start exercising again
""
i have some mild side effects from the vyvanse like a slightly elevated heart rate resting at 8090bpm on it 7080bpm off it and there have been a handful of times where ive experienced palpitations these palpitations lasted for a couple of minutes and would go away id say this has happened maybe 5 times in the past 15 years of being on it
""
i am concerned about starting to exercise again because its clear that the vyvanse is making my heart work a bit harder ive been sedentary for so long that i worry ill hurt my heart if i jump right into cardio while taking this medication
""
so is it safe to start exercising do i need to ease into it to get my heart used to it should i take any precautions
""
thanks in advance im tired of feeling bad due to a lack of exercise i used to be very active and i can definitely tell the difference

hello there i am currently suffering with health anxiety and i have not been diagnosed with this disease i just know i have it because whenever i read about heart related stuff online and whenever i read something i feel adrenaline in my stomach and my body and my heart rate goes up and i have a panic attack i know it is a panic attack because i have a sense of impending doom anyway until now i have answered all of my brains questions and if i get an answer to this last question i can conclude that i am not in danger so let me explain i went to the hospital because i was having a panic attack after i stayed up all night for months and if you are wondering i stayed up all night and i slept during the day for a about a month anyway i had a panic attack while i was watching naruto fore some reason and it was that part where sacuras squeezed narutos heart and fore some reason that caused a panic attack and i was outside for about 10 minutes just my hand on my chest nothing was happening if i look back on it now but just fast heart rate and sleep deprived but i thought i was having a heart attack i did not even know what a heart attack was but i thought i was having one because anxiety makes you think irrationally but yea i went to the hospital not he emergency room but just the hospital and they set me down and attached an ecg on me and the cardiologist was asking me questions and i only told him i had stayed up all night bare in mind that i still had a fast heart rate after this they took some blood to run some tests after that they took the ecg off me after about 30 minutes and took me to another cardiologist this time they did a paper ecg and after that they took me to and he did an echo and listed to my heart with the echo and with the stethoscope they did not see anything on 2 ecgs blood test and echo so the cardiologist told me what i might have he said that i might have an infection of the layer around the heart but he was not sure so he went and gave me a few more blood tests and we waited 2 hours and it was all good they said i was healthy but my anxiety did not stop because i was still worried and then i went to another cardiologist this one had 30years of experience and he also did an echo and ecg and he also listend at my heart with a stethoscope my heart rate was up because i fore some reason i got anxiety from being at the doctors office so after all of the tests with took about an hour he said i was fine and that i sould stop looking at stuff on the internet and after this doctor visit all of the symptoms of anxiety went all away but they came back so my details
""
i am a 15 year old im 67 kilograms or 147 pounds i have been checked by over 3 cardiologists and they all said my heart is healthy i dont have any family history of heart disease literally none my grandparents on my fathers side lived until 7879 and my grandparents on my mothers side lived till 8081 so yea i have no symptoms of heart disease i havent been diagnosed with any heart disease or any heart problems
""
how easily can doctors detect not diagnose but detect that u have some sort of serius heart disease
""
answer the question if u have the knowledge please dont comment unless u have the answer
""
and please dont give me any anxiety tips please just answer the questions i have gotten plenty of anxiety tips but yea just answer those questions whenever anybody answers these questions and just because i have health anxiety dont lie to me

thank you
