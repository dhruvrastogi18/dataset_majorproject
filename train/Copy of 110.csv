6,110_6,6,110_6,49_6,T,"So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay. Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay. ",id,,
7,110_7,7,110_7,49_7,P,"Yeah, yeah, that's all right. Will it only be with your supervisor?",yq,id,
8,110_8,8,110_8,49_8,T," Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah. There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality. That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else. Okay. If you tell me that you've been involved in a serious crime, okay for us. Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I'm required to give that information then okay. But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first. Okay, that'd be good. Okay. All right. All right. So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well. It's just our fee here at the clinic. Yes. Which as we discussed on the phone is $20.",ack,id,
9,110_9,9,110_9,49_9,P,Yes. And that's fine. No problems.,id,,
10,110_10,10,110_10,49_10,T,Okay. And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment. We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time.,id,,
11,110_11,11,110_11,49_11,P,"Yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries. ",op,,
12,110_12,12,110_12,49_12,T,Okay. Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there?,yq,,

16,110_16,16,110_16,49_16,T,"Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you're having at the moment. Okay. ",id,,
17,110_17,17,110_17,49_17,P,Yeah. Sounds good.,ack,,
18,110_18,18,110_18,49_18,T,"So the purpose of today's session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what's happening for you lately. All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah. And at the end, we can sort of have a touch base again and see how we went for today and whether we'd like to take it on from there.",id,,

20,110_20,20,110_20,49_20,T,"Yes, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, just to start off with then I guess, are there any other things that you've tried apart from coming to therapy and As some ways to help you cope with what's happening for you.",irq,,
