0,115_0,0,115_0,53_0,T,"Okay, Felicity, before we start to talk about what you've come here to see me for today, I just wanted to raise an issue with you. I think we both realized when you walked in here that we've seen each other before. ",id,,
1,115_1,1,115_1,53_1,P,"Yeah, I'm Jake's mom. I've seen you at kindy. ",ack,,
2,115_2,2,115_2,53_2,T,"That's right. That's right. We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten. So I suppose what that brings up for me is that I'm a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients. And I think that we need to talk about what we're going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we're going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room.",id,,
3,115_3,3,115_3,53_3,P,Okay. Yeah.,ack,,
4,115_4,4,115_4,53_4,T," So how I say this, we have a few different options. The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together. Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy. Okay, how would that option sit for you? ",irq,,
5,115_5,5,115_5,53_5,P,"Well, um, I guess, part of the problem for me is that I really, I feel that I really need to talk to someone about what's going on for me and I don't really, there's no one else in town I can talk to okay. ",id,,
6,115_6,6,115_6,53_6,T,"Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area. Yeah. Okay. So you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you've got. So given that that's the case. How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms so that we don't cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients. So if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you like to manage it? ",irq,id,
7,115_7,7,115_7,53_7,P,"No, I mean, I think I think it's good if you know if we can, like say hi and stuff, but I mean, I probably Probably wouldn't want to talk to you at kindy about what we do here in case other people hear it.",id,,
8,115_8,8,115_8,53_8,T,"Sure, sure. And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy. Yeah, yeah. I'm glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate. ",id,,
9,115_9,9,115_9,53_9,P,"Yeah. Yeah.  And I mean, you wouldn't, you wouldn't tell anybody other moms, would you?",irq,,
10,115_10,10,115_10,53_10,T,"No, no, I'm, I would definitely keep it confidential, that we're in a therapeutic relationship together. Nobody else needs to yet be aware of that. Okay. ",id,,
11,115_11,11,115_11,53_11,P,"So it's kind of like, we've got therapy for in here, but then out there. We're just mums. ",id,,
12,115_12,12,115_12,53_12,T,"That's exactly right. So if we could just keep it at you know, those things separate then I don't think we should run into any problems in therapy. Yeah, but perhaps we could check in from time to time to see you know, whether that It's becoming a problem for ",ack,id,
13,115_13,13,115_13,53_13,P,"Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.",ack,,
14,115_14,14,115_14,53_14,T," Do you think that sounds okay? Yep. All right. So now that we've discussed that issue, yeah. Let's talk about why you've come in to talk to me today. ",id,,
15,115_15,15,115_15,53_15,P,Okay.,ack,,
