And we'll have plenty of time talk about the different structures in CBT. I do want to explain it to you but over the course of several sessions, let's just take pieces of it for now. Okay. So far we believe is that your beliefs combined with a situation and create these thoughts. So you have this belief, so you're laying in bed for work, and you have this belief that you're maybe not competent. And then the situation that combines with that is, it's time to go to work. So the stress of No, it being time to actually get up and get ready to work. And then you have an automatic thought in that moment. Can right now it's one tied to dread and fear. Let's try to identify an exact one for this example. So let's use that scenario. You believe that you might not be confident you're laying in bed, and the alarm clock goes off. So you're kind of pressured to make a decision about do I get ready for work or not? What's the thought right then?",id,irq,
1,130_1,1,130_1,67_1,P,"if I go to work I'm going to make a mistake,",id,,-2.0
2,130_2,2,130_2,67_2,T,"So if I go, I'm going to make a mistake. And then we talked about your reactions being late. Worry, anxiety. So what we'd like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it. So really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now. ",id,irq,
3,130_3,3,130_3,67_3,P,"So I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself?",crq,,
4,130_4,4,130_4,67_4,T,"It's a good question. We'll work on that. And that's what we can do now. Let's take a look at some self talk. So some adaptive responses so they can build. So I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time. Has there ever been times when you've had that thought? And you went to work on time still? ",id,yq,
5,130_5,5,130_5,67_5,P,Yeah.,op,,
6,130_6,6,130_6,67_6,T,What was different about those times?,irq,,
7,130_7,7,130_7,67_7,P,"I guess I told myself, I have to get to work on time because if I don't, it's going to be even worse. If I make a mistake, and I'm late that it just, you know, it compounds and I guess I would tell myself, it's gonna be okay. You just have to get through this day. ",id,,-2.0
8,130_8,8,130_8,67_8,T,"Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk. Okay. All right. So that's, that's really the same thing except you probably didn't have a label for it. And when you apply that it seems to work. So the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. So there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. Right self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.",id,,
